Enterprises   by   Benjamin Alan Dawson   Submitted to the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Engineering Systems Division on May 6   2011 in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degrees of Master of Business Administration   and Master of Science in Engineering Systems   Abstract   This thesis examines strategies to accelerate product development in a large commercial aerospace   program structured as an extended enterprise where first and second tier suppliers perform most of the   detailed product development  Two of the program s primary objectives are to increase fuel efficiency   and to reduce development time  Several structural engineering challenges and unanticipated delays   have put these objectives at risk  This thesis examines the hypothesis that the program s product   development enterprise is misaligned with the product architecture and that this generates undesired   dynamic behaviors in the product development system  especially oscillation in loads on the airframe   and in component designs    This work explores the specific causes of observed dynamic behavior in the design process during which   suppliers and the OEM fail to come to agreement on important design parameters that affect weight    structural loads  and the resulting internal stresses in the structure  In addition  it suggests alternate   strategies for dealing with engineering design changes and presents a simulation game and an agent   based model whereby it tests whether these strategies reduce the dynamically induced delays    Thesis Supervisor

tremendous contributions and support of many   others  I deeply appreciate all the individual and team contributions that have helped make it a reality    First  I would like to thank Spirit AeroSystems  and Tom Greenwood and Daniel Allison in particular  for   sponsoring my internship that allowed this research  While at Spirit I was constantly impressed by the   warmth of its people and their drive for excellence  My project supervisor Curtis Grewing was a   constant support and brilliant source of information on all of the key issues regarding the central   problems of this thesis  I could not have asked for a more supportive and enthusiastic project champion   than Tom Greenwood  who was generous with his very limited time and offered penetrating insights   that helped shape my research  Colin Davidson  Joe Pineda  and their team of stress and design   engineers shared invaluable information about their work and anecdotes that also informed this work    Matt Hamilton and Travis Gracewski shared valuable insights from their own LGO experiences and were   genuine friends  A few others at Spirit played critical supporting roles  On short notice Don Burch and   Keith Engel seized the opportunity to facilitate a workshop for human simulation of the game   described in this thesis  I am still amazed at their ability to mobilize all the right resources and   participants for that workshop in such a brief period  Without their timely support  many of the key   points made in this thesis would not have been discovered  Finally  I appreciate Stuart Collier and   Shannon Hill for helping me color inside the lines    My thesis advisors  Daniel Whitney and Sebastian Fixson  deserve a great deal of credit for helping   shape the direction of this research and especially for helping me organize its findings in writing  Their   own previous research provided many useful starting points for this work and both were generous with   their time  energy and ideas    I would also like to thank the faculty and staff of the LGO program for their tireless efforts to grow and   improve the program and to keep it running smoothly  In addition I appreciate the camaraderie of my   brilliant cohort of LGO classmates  My experience at MIT and my perspectives on life have been   thoroughly enriched by my interaction with each    Most importantly I want to thank my family  My extraordinary wife Brittany has been a constant    patient support throughout this experience  without whom it would have been impossible  My son   Grayden has also been patient through the writing of this thesis and a constant source of joy  My   parents  siblings  and extended family all provided a firm foundation on which to build my life and   have been an unwavering network of support to me and countless others  I thank you all    5                                            This page intentionally left blank       6    Table of Contents   Abstract

thesis examines product development in a large commercial aerospace program structured as an   extended enterprise and explores strategies to accelerate product development in that ecosystem    While certain aspects of this ecosystem are unique to the commercial aerospace industry  many of the   conditions that create a challenging product development environment for this program may be found   in other industries that develop complex products and systems    The aircraft program in question1 is structured as an extended enterprise where first and second tier   suppliers perform most of the detailed product development  Two of the program s primary objectives   are to achieve unprecedented fuel efficiency relative to similarly sized aircraft and to significantly   reduce development time  Several structural engineering challenges and unanticipated delays to the   program s product development schedule have put these objectives at risk    1 1  Objective    Human performance in complex dynamic environments is poor relative to normative standards  and   even compared to simple decision rules   Sterman  1994     This thesis examines the hypothesis that the product development enterprise is misaligned with the   product architecture and that intuitive development strategies in this environment generate some of   the very undesired dynamic behaviors in the product development system they are intended to prevent    It explores the specific causes of observed dynamic behavior in the design process during which   suppliers and the original equipment manufacturer  OEM  fail to come to agreement on important   design parameters that affect weight  structural loads  and the resulting internal stresses in the   structure  In addition  it suggests alternate strategies for dealing with engineering design changes and   presents a simulation game and agent based model whereby it tests whether these strategies reduce   the dynamically induced delays    1 2  Project Motivation and Hypothesis   This thesis research was conducted during a six month internship as part of a partnership between   Spirit AeroSystems and the MIT Leaders for Global Operations  LGO  program  LGO is a partnership   between the MIT School of Engineering  the MIT Sloan School of Management  and several operations   focused companies from around the world  Its purpose is to discover the principles that produce world   class  operations oriented companies and leaders  and to translate those principles into teaching and   practice                                                        1 For confidentiality reasons this thesis does not identify the aircraft program specifically    12    Spirit AeroSystems is currently engaged as a supplier of large carbon fiber composite airframe   components to a major new aircraft program  with detailed design and manufacturing responsibility   for structural fuselage and wing components  During the product development phase of engineering   the first variant of this aircraft  Spirit s wing structure engineering team received several unplanned   updates to structural loads  requirements  and mandated analysis software tools from its OEM   customer  which forced the team to perform significant engineering rework  One member of the   program management staff estimated the team had done the work of designing its components five to   six times over  and Spirit s Program Manager for the wing structure components estimated that only   one third of his team s engineering effort meaningfully contributed toward the final design  the   remainder being superseded by later rework  While this research was conducted primarily under the   auspices of the wing structures team  leaders of the fuselage team participated in interviews and   described similar symptoms  The extra time Spirit and other suppliers spent on rework driven by these   and similar changes caused milestone deadlines to slip for the entire aircraft program and resulted in   undisclosed millions of dollars in supplier claims against the OEM for compensation    Spirit s team spent a significant portion of this rework in tasks within the structural sizing loop  The   sizing loop is the process whereby members of the enterprise determine the components  proper   geometries and thicknesses with the aim of supporting structural loads while minimizing mass  Since   stress is load per unit area  larger or thicker structural elements reduce stress but increase component   mass  The design process must resolve the obvious conflict between keeping mass low while keeping   stresses within requirements  As each supplier makes design changes in response to implicit or explicit   requests from the OEM to reduce either weight or stress  those changes affect the loads that each   supplier s parts exert on other parts  requiring further adjustments to those parts  thicknesses  The   tasks and the exchange of information to meet both stress and mass objectives are called the sizing   loop  The Spirit team s engineering manager commented that  we expected two sizing loops and   instead  there were  eight     This thesis focuses primarily on the loads changes related to the sizing loop across the extended   enterprise as a concrete and tractable example of how misalignment of product and enterprise   architecture generates design oscillation  Other changes  such as changes to analysis software and   high level requirements also cause delays and rework  this thesis will not address them because their   effects are very context sensitive and explaining them would disclose proprietary information    At this internship project s outset Spirit s wing structures team members enumerated the   aforementioned symptoms and easily identified their proximate causes  but could not articulate a   coherent theory of their underlying sources  Nevertheless  company experience with other aircraft   13    programs had convinced the team there were significant opportunities to accelerate the product   development process for future variants of this aircraft    Several past LGO theses have explored strategies to accelerate product development  These strategies   have included the use of Design Structure Matrices  Rogers  2009   simulation models  MacDonald    2006  Mar  1999   and analytical models  Bromberg  2000   as well as case studies  Folgo  2008    MacDonald  2006   and application of the theory of constraints  Cook  1998   One previous work that   pursues an approach similar to this thesis combines a system dynamics model and a board game   replicating internal and external supply process for stamping die development at an automotive   manufacturer  Kelly  1996   The board game became a training tool to help the manufacturer s   managers understand how to work more effectively in the complex  dynamic system of which they   were a part    Two other papers on related topics offer suggestions for managing the design of complex systems to   accelerate design convergence  Mihm et al  study problem solving oscillations in a mathematical model   of a theoretical complex design project  offering several insights into its behavior and suggestions to   improve its performance  2003   Braha and Bar Yam study the statistical mechanics of information flow   in product development networks  2007   Their conclusions suggest that improvement efforts focused   on central information consuming and information generating tasks can drastically alter the network s   performance  Both of these works are addressed later in greater detail    1 3  Hypothesis   As stated earlier  this work examines the hypothesis that in this program the product development   enterprise is misaligned with the product architecture and that this misalignment generates undesired   dynamic behaviors in the product development system    This hypothesis is here broken in two            The sizing loop is analogous to a dynamic system with time delay    The theory of control of time delay feedback systems can be applied to the aircraft sizing loop   and doing so can result in fewer iterations of the sizing loop and faster convergence to a   design that meets the conflicting goals of meeting stress requirements and minimizing mass    1 4  Synopsis   This section presents a brief synopsis of the research and findings to act as a roadmap for the reader    The author first considers the nature of the studied composite materials aerostructures in light of   product architecture literature  This body of theory clearly indicates that the modern airframe    composed of many aerostructures  is an inherently integrated product  The process of developing   14    complex integrated products exhibits several well known behaviors  such as iteration and cascades of   changes in component designs  The author next evaluates the organizational structure of the product   development effort  in the context of relevant literature  and demonstrates it is clearly more   decentralized than past programs for similar aircraft  This structure reduces and slows communication   throughout the enterprise    The combined behaviors of integrated product development and decentralized development efforts   induce engineers to attempt to optimize component designs with each enterprise wide design   iteration  This both delays the sharing of design updates and causes higher amplitude changes to   designs with each iteration  However  engineers underestimate how much changes to their   components affect the parameters for requirements that other components must meet  High amplitude   design changes that alter loads on other components force further iterations  and delays make them   take even longer    With these issues in mind the author developed a simulation exercise game patterned after the basic   problem structure that engineers in the aircraft program face  The game exists in two formats  one for   human players and another for automated agent based simulation  After interviewing Spirit engineers   to ascertain the relevant current policies in the aircraft program  the author approximated these   policies as decision rules in the agent based simulation  Simulations with agents using these decision   rules yields design oscillation that delays final product definition  as predicted by the theory described   in the previous paragraph  The author next tests the effects of three decision rule changes  more   frequently running a global stress model that determines loads on components and separately relaxing   the upper and lower constraints for suppliers to submit updated designs to the agent representing the   OEM  Finding that each of these changes alone reduces the time to design convergence  the author   testes the combined effect of all three changes and finds they consistently result in much earlier   convergence    The author next facilitated sessions of the game with senior engineers and program managers at Spirit    During the first round of the game the participants pursued their intuitive strategies  resulting in design   and loads oscillation that delayed final design definition  the very phenomena that participants    strategies were intended to minimize  After a debriefing and discussion  during the second round of   the game participants implemented the combined decision rule changes described above  The results of   the second round of the game confirm that these strategy changes significantly reduce design   convergence time similar to the agent model  These simulation outcomes illustrate that experts working   on this problem under strategies intended to minimize development time and oscillation can actually   increase these undesired system behaviors  but that alternative strategies can reduce such behaviors   significantly    15    1 5  Thesis Outline   This chapter has presented an overview of the

several of the forces that shaped the environment in which   Spirit s team worked and which contributed to the challenges it faced    2 1  Company Context   Headquartered in Wichita  KS  Spirit AeroSystems  Inc  is the world s largest independent non OEM   aircraft parts designer and manufacturer of commercial aerostructures2 Spirit AeroSystems  2011   It   owns and operates manufacturing and assembly facilities in Wichita  KS  Tulsa  OK  McAlester  OK    Kinston  NC  Prestwick  Scotland  Saint Nazaire  France and Subang  Malaysia  Spirit AeroSystems    2011   Spirit s customers include Gulfstream  Mitsubishi  Bombardier  Sikorsky  Rolls Royce  Hawker   Beechcraft  Israeli Aerospace Industries  Boeing  Airbus  the United States government  Cathay Pacific    Continental Airlines  American Airlines  and Southwest Airlines  Spirit AeroSystems  2011     Spirit AeroSystems is in the unusual position of being a five year old company with eighty years of   experience  Spirit s Wichita location began as the factory for Stearman Aircraft in 1927  Boeing   acquired Stearman in 1929  and the site grew into Boeing s Wichita Division  During World War II the   division produced the B 29 Superfortress and later the B 47 Stratojet and B 52 Superfortress aircraft  In   more recent decades it served as the production site for many structural components of Boeing s   commercial aircraft family  In 2005  Boeing Commercial Airplanes sold the Wichita Division  which   included its Tulsa  OK and McAlester  OK sites  to Canadian investment firm Onex Corporation  which   named the new company Spirit AeroSystems  In 2006  Spirit acquired BAE Systems  aerostructures   business  converting it to a wholly owned subsidiary named Spirit AeroSystems  Europe  Ltd  Spirit first   offered stock to the market in late 2006  though ONEX retains majority ownership of Spirit   AeroSystems Holdings  Inc    Boeing was the only source of Spirit s revenue at the divestment  Since then Spirit has aggressively   diversified its customer base so that its fortunes no longer depend any single other company  Most   importantly  it has developed a significant business relationship with Boeing s primary competitor   Airbus  83  of 2010 revenues were from Boeing and 11  were from Airbus  Spirit AeroSystems  2011     This puts Spirit in a well hedged position in the jetliner business if either of the Boeing Airbus duopoly   pulls ahead  Spirit has a strong business relationship with the leader    Spirit manufactures aerostructures for every Boeing Commercial Airplanes aircraft currently in   production  It provides most of the airframe for the Boeing 737 jetliner  For the Boeing 787  Spirit                                                       2 Aerostructure is the industry term for structural airframe components    17    manufactures the forward fuselage  including the cockpit section  the wing leading edges  and the   engine pylons  This work package makes Spirit the largest aerostructures supplier for the 787    With its addition of Spirit Europe  Spirit AeroSystems also became the largest independent   aerostructures supplier to Airbus  Spirit Europe manufactures components for the Airbus A320  A330    A340  A350  and A380 families    2 2  Industry Context   The commercial airline industry is in rapid transition  shaped by a variety of forces such as increasing   globalization of production and demand  growing demand for air travel  rising petroleum prices  and   explosions of information technology for global collaboration  One important trend that is relevant to   this thesis is the growth of extended enterprises  often termed risk sharing partnerships in the industry    to develop new aircraft    2 2 1  Toward Risk Sharing Extended Enterprises   The enormous cost of developing large new commercial aircraft has begun driving OEMs toward   outsourcing detailed design work to suppliers and asking them to take equity shares in the aircraft   program  OEMs generate design concepts and principles  then act primarily as integrators between the   supplier teams developing detailed designs of the various systems and components  Embraer recently   implemented this strategy to develop and manufacture its ERJ 170 190 family of regional jets with   great success reducing both development time and cost  Figueiredo  Silveira    Sbragia  2008     The two most prominent aircraft programs implementing the extended enterprise business model are   the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 XWB  Both Boeing and Airbus have essentially announced   intentions to become large scale systems integrators  though each intends to retain differentiating   commercial aircraft capabilities  Airbus frames this as a focus on activities such as overall aircraft and   cabin architecture  systems integration  and the development and testing of new technologies  Airbus    2007   Boeing Commercial Airplanes intends to focus on its core capabilities in final assembly of   fuselage  interiors  and propulsion systems  Dustman  2004     At the outset of the 787 s development effort  a Business Week article explained that  for the first time    with the 787  Boeing is outsourcing more than 70  of the airframe and is giving aircraft suppliers the   responsibility for doing the detail engineering designs   Holmes  2006   The article offers several   explanations for this departure from Boeing s traditional in house design approach  First  and most apt   to its name  the risk sharing partner model allows Boeing to spread the enormous cost of developing   the aircraft across several companies  Instead of paying for development costs itself  Boeing offered its   risk sharing partner suppliers an equity stake in the aircraft in exchange for paying development costs   18    themselves  Second  Boeing needed to locate some manufacturing work in countries such as China and   India as part of offset agreements allowing it to sell airplanes in those quickly growing markets  In   addition  outsourcing the design gave Boeing access to engineering labor beyond its own walls and   helped improve design for manufacture  Mike Bair  the then program manager of the 787 also   explained that  one of the things we have found  is that  it s best to have the people building the parts   designing the parts   Finally  choosing suppliers from around the world also helped hedge Boeing   against the risks of currency fluctuations    Airbus similarly outsourced roughly 50  of the A350 XWB aerostructures  about twice as much as in   past programs  Airbus  2007   In introducing Airbus  Power8 restructuring plan in 2007  CEO Louis   Gallois said  We will turn Airbus into an extended enterprise  The A350 XWB will draw on this new   business model  as we assign large work packages to Tier 1 suppliers in return for a better distribution   of future investment  risks and opportunities  with a consolidated supply base   Airbus  2007   The   A350 risk sharing partnership is a smaller departure from tradition than Boeing s 787 approach  While   A350 risk sharing partners also have equity stakes in each aircraft  Airbus also compensates supplier   partners at a roughly  break even  rate for development efforts  with periodic payments when the   program reaches development milestones    Despite high initial hopes  both the 787 and A350 have experienced setbacks that have delayed delivery   to customers and caused both aircraft to fall short of intended performance  Boeing originally planned   for the 787 to enter service in May of 2008  but at the writing of this thesis that had been pushed back   to July 2011  Ostrower  2011   Aviationweek com noted that  longer than anticipated design activities   for the A350XWB twin widebody are forcing Airbus to delay the aircraft s final assembly start and first   flight by several months   Wall  2010   Both aircraft have also been overweight at some point in their   development  the first six 787 delivered are expected to be approximately 5 000 lb  above specifications   and a June 2010 article put the A350 2 2 tons overweight  FleetBuzz Editorial  2010   One Airbus   supplier characterized the position the delays and excess mass have put them in     We  can  either  aim  to  deliver  on  time  and   it  will   be  overweight  or  be  delayed  and  get  the  weight right  The longer we leave this  we ll be in the throes of ramping up production   there  won t be enough resources to dedicate to that  production ramp up  and deal with the weight    FleetBuzz Editorial  2010     Both programs face difficult choices as they try to reduce mass while making up for lost time to deliver   to their customers    19    2 3  Aircraft Program Context   This section briefly describes the relatively new business model that characterizes the relationship   between the OEM and its suppliers for this program  and the program s overall objectives    2 3 1  Risk Sharing Partnership   The aircraft program studied for this thesis is structured as an extended enterprise of several well   known aerospace suppliers from around the world working under the leadership of the OEM  The OEM   acts as an integrator and hub for interfacing partners to share information and coordinate their   development efforts  In fact in this program  the OEM has discouraged suppliers from collaborating   directly with one another  encouraging them instead to use the OEM as an intermediary  As will be   discussed later  this may stem from a desire to protect proprietary information between suppliers who   compete on other programs and to prevent suppliers from gaining the institutional knowledge to   eventually displace the OEM  Some Spirit personnel also theorized this was an approach to maintain   schedule pressure on all suppliers by preventing  fast  suppliers from learning of delays at others  But   as the reader shall see  this may be a prime cause of the delays discussed in Chapter 1    2 3 2  Program Objectives   The program studied for this project has two primary objectives that are relevant to this research  First    the OEM seeks to develop an extremely fuel efficient aircraft to meet airlines  demand for more fuel   efficient fleets  Second  the OEM seeks to bring the aircraft to market quickly  Many airlines are   rumored to be deciding between this aircraft and a direct competitor  delivery date and operating   costs  driven by fuel efficiency  are two of the most important dimensions they will consider    Aging long range fleets and rising petroleum prices have generated intense airline interest in   lightweight long range aircraft  A January 2009 Seattle Post Intelligencer article observed that  airlines   hoping to save on fuel bills are eagerly awaiting both the 787 and the A350  Both models are designed   to be more energy efficient than aircraft flying today thanks to a greater use of composite carbon   materials   Vandore  2009   In addition to its unprecedented use of composite materials  the program   has aggressively sought to optimize every possible aspect of the design to safely eliminate excess mass    For example  the OEM has insisted that at each phase of development efforts  risk sharing partners   submit highly optimized designs that minimize mass while still meeting stress and other design   requirements  Later discussion will outline the many ways that aircraft mass influences airline operating   costs and other costs    A second primary objective is to minimize development time  There are at least three key reasons the   OEM seeks to develop the aircraft quickly  The earlier the OEM can promise delivery to its customers    the better its position to gain market share against competing aircraft  Further  the sooner the OEM   20    can begin delivering the aircraft to its customers  the sooner it can begin to recoup the enormous cost   of product development and capital outlay for manufacturing equipment  Finally  if the program is   delayed  the OEM incurs significant penalties for late deliveries to its customers    2 4  Aerostructures in the Aircraft   The components at the focus of this research are aerostructures  These are components that make up   the airframe of the aircraft  especially the fuselage and wing  Their primary function is to collectively   bear the structural loads on the aircraft in all operating conditions  In this function components   transfer loads one to another at their interfaces  This means that each aerostructure must be designed   with an understanding of the loads that interfacing aerostructures will exert on it    Some aerostructures perform dual functions  For example  in addition to bearing loads  wing   aerostructures form the aircraft s most important aerodynamic surfaces and often constitute the fuel   tank  The optimal design for one of these functions is rarely the optimal design for another  often the   best design for one role is not even feasible for another  Engineers for such structures must therefore   generate designs that perform acceptably across all functions  performance parameters    2 4 1  Composite Aerostructures   The main source of weight savings in this aircraft is the use of composite materials  such as carbon   fiber reinforced polymers  in its aerostructures  Earlier generations of commercial aircraft have used   composite materials but never to the degree the current generation uses them  This introduces new   opportunities and constraints that reshape the design space for the aircraft  While composite materials    high strength to mass ratios make them attractive options for reducing mass  other properties add   significant challenges to producing composite material structural parts    First  the technologies to design  manufacture  and test composite materials are still maturing     Companies using these technologies have learned many lessons during product development for   mostly composite aircraft  some of them very publicly  For example  Boeing s 787 engineers discovered   late in its design process that earlier plans to dissipate electrical charges from lightning strikes were   insufficient  Metallic airframes conduct electricity while composite materials insulate against it  In a   composite aircraft  lightning would seek a path through the aircraft s few metallic parts like fasteners    hinges  and wiring  Such small parts would likely fuse or vaporize  and the possibility of fuel ignition   had been raised  The 787 program had to make compensating changes  adding approximately five   thousand pounds to the aircraft s mass  This required significant engineering rework to make the   changes themselves and to make accommodating changes elsewhere  The Airbus A350 XWB also made   late changes to fastener requirements to manage similar lightning strike risks    21    To manufacture composite aerostructures  strips or sheets of composite material are layered on a   precisely engineered metal tool and then cured in an autoclave  After curing  composite components   can be trimmed and drilled but their shape and thickness are fixed  The curing process generates   residual stresses that cause the component to deflect from the shape in which it was cured  Because   these deflections can exceed dimensional tolerances  they must be accurately anticipated and   counteracted in the tooling geometry  While the corresponding manufacturing processes for metallic   parts also generate residual stresses and deflections  the technology to anticipate and counteract these   effects is quite mature while analysis methods for composite material deflections are still in their   infancy    Earlier aluminum aircraft often began production with the intention of continuing engineering   improvements to be incorporated in later production units  According to experts at Spirit  any change   in composite component geometry or thickness is likely to affect the residual stresses from curing and   thus affect the tooling design  Because these tools are expensive and difficult  if not impossible  to   modify  this raises the stakes for making engineering changes to the component after tooling has been   built  Since finished tooling is essential for production  this links development delays rather firmly to   production and aircraft delivery delays    2 5  Balancing Stress and Mass   Two of the most important product characteristics aerostructures engineers must balance are stress   and mass  This section introduces the reader to the role they play in aerostructures and the method by   which engineers in the enterprise balance the two to optimize aerostructure performance    2 5 1  Mass and Aerostructure Design   As petroleum prices have risen steeply throughout the past decade  fuel efficiency has become   drastically more important to airlines because fuel represents an increasing proportion of operating   costs  In response  aircraft OEMs have sought to significantly reduce airframe mass  Reducing airframe   mass allows the plane to either carry more fuel  increasing its range  or to carry more passengers or   cargo  either adds to airlines  revenue  While composite materials provide substantial strength to mass   advantages over aluminum  manufacturers must still aggressively eliminate excess mass wherever   possible to meet current airline expectations    When airlines commit to purchase aircraft they incorporate contract clauses regarding target mass to   offset the costs of excess mass  If the delivered aircraft exceeds this target mass  the airline is entitled to   assess penalties against the OEM in proportion to the overage  and these mass targets cascade into   supplier contracts  In its request for quote  RFQ  documents sent to potential suppliers  the OEM   proposes a mass target for the component in question  as well as targets for price and delivery dates    22    Proposed mass targets are estimates based on mass distributions in similar metallic aircraft  However    with the new opportunities and constraints of composite materials  there is no guarantee the ideal   distribution will remain the same for all components  Contract targets are negotiable  but constitute   primary performance measures by which the OEM evaluates bids  so suppliers are reluctant to revise   them upward    Aerostructure supply contracts include penalty and incentive clauses tied to component mass  If the   supplier delivers a component that exceeds agreed target mass  it is subject to a significant penalty   proportional to the overage  If the component is significantly overweight  the penalties could be large   enough to eliminate the supplier s profit for that part  Similarly  when the supplier delivers a   component weighing less than the target mass  it receives an incentive payment proportional to the   mass savings  Penalties per unit of mass are typically much higher than incentive payments per unit   mass    Excess mass also adds to supply chain costs and airport landing fees  Airport companies charge fees to   land airplanes at their airports  and the fees depend in part on mass  with heavier airplanes incurring   larger fees  Excess mass in the design is also excess material which must be purchased  and composite   material is very expensive  In composite material designs  excess material must be laid ply by ply on   molding tools  tying up extremely capital intensive equipment  The excess mass must also be shipped   throughout the supply chain  adding to total production costs  These factors add to the pressure for   suppliers and the OEM to reduce mass    2 5 2  Stress and Aerostructure Design   In order to fly safely  and to receive flight certification from regulatory agencies such as the US Federal   Aviation Administration or the European Aviation Safety Administration  airframes must be engineered   to ensure the structure is strong enough to withstand all the loads they must bear  The loads on a   component  combined with its geometric and material strength properties  determine the stress in each   part of the component  If stress in any component is too high  the component will fail    Safety factors  sometimes called design factors or reserve factors  are an important set of metrics in   structural engineering  including for aerostructures  These values give the ratio of allowable stress   divided by actual or calculated stress  For example  if the heaviest loads on a component are expected   to create 100 units of stress  requirements might call for a safety factor of 1 5  meaning the design   must withstand 150 units of stress  If the calculated stress exceeds the allowable stress  the safety   factor will fall below the required safety factor  while if the allowable stress exceeds the calculated   stress  the safety factor will be above its target value  Safety factors below the target value are   unacceptable in a final design they indicate the design cannot withstand all the loads it is intended to   23    bear  On the other hand  safety factors above the target value indicate excess material that decreases   fuel efficiency without adding structural value  In practice  engineers often treat the safety factors of   areas within each component as a proxy metric to identify and quantify excess mass    Target safety factors can vary such that some loads and components might require safety factors of 2 0   while others might require 1 5  For simplicity and clarity  this thesis normalizes safety factors to 1 0 so   that a safety factor of 1 0 represents the condition where the maximum allowable stress per the   requirement is equal to the calculated stress at the point in question  This means that in all discussions   of the sizing loop  the ideal safety factor for any component is 1 0    2 5 3  The Sizing Loop   As noted earlier  Spirit s team spent much of its rework effort in the sizing loop tasks to determine the   proper geometries and thicknesses to balance stress and mass in their component  The design thickness   determines the number of composite material plies to be laid on one another and cured to form the   part  The term sizing loop is used because these tasks form a goal seeking feedback loop whereby the   program attempts to meet stress requirements with minimum mass  generally using safety factors as a   metric of optimality    The sizing loop process begins when the OEM incorporates design updates from suppliers into its   global finite element model for stress analysis of the entire aircraft or for a large section such as the   wing  By evaluating the finite element model against the structural loads applied to the overall aircraft    the OEM determines the loads applied to each component  While the external environment applies   some of the loads  many of them are called interface loads because they transfer from one airframe   component to another at the interface between the two  Ribs in the aircraft s wing  for example  only   experience loads as exerted on them by neighboring components and not from external air pressures     Figure 1 shows the tasks in the sizing loop  The sizing loop is actually two sizing loops  one inside the   other  The inner loop  labeled the supplier sizing loop  occurs at the supplier stress team level consists   of adjusting thicknesses to balance stress and mass given the most recently delivered interface loads    the dashed green line shows the path of tasks and decisions in this loop  The outer loop  labeled the   enterprise loop  treats design updates from suppliers the same way suppliers treat thickness changes   for their components  the dashed blue lines show the tasks and decisions for this loop  Design changes   feed into the global finite element model to evaluate how well the current designs collectively meet   overall stress and mass requirements    24       Figure 1  The Sizing Loop   After running its global finite element stress model  the OEM notifies suppliers of updated load sets for   each component  Each supplier then downloads the updated loads data and converts it into a format   appropriate for its local finite element stress analysis tools  Then the supplier team incorporates the   new loads in a local stress model  which it uses to evaluate and adjust its design  Running the local   stress model typically requires a few hours and engineers receive reports of safety factors after the full   analysis is complete  Supplier engineers use safety factors as a direct measure of whether the design   meets stress requirements and as a proxy measure for whether there are areas with excess mass    Accordingly  they add material to areas with safety factors below 1 0 and may remove it from areas   with safety factors above 1 0 in an effort to reduce mass  then run the local stress model again  The   follow this process until all safety factors fall within upper and lower safety factor thresholds  When   this design update is complete the supplier submits its updated design to the OEM for the next sizing   loop iteration    Engineers at Spirit said the lowest allowable safety factor in a submitted design at any phase of the   detailed design process is 1 0  meaning all parts of the design meet minimum stress requirements  The   25    upper threshold is between about 1 05 and 1 10  reflecting an aggressive goal to minimize excess   material in any part of the component design  If designs meet these requirements before milestone   deadlines engineers typically continue optimizing the design to remove excess mass  Spirit engineers   indicated that this approach reflects the program OEM s expectations  and also matched engineers    practice at Spirit for other programs and aerospace engineering practice in general    Figure 2 shows a causal loop diagram explaining how stress and mass create conflicting goals and   requirements  Plus signs next to arrows indicate a direct causal relationship if the cause parameter   increases the effect

italic text       Figure 2  Stress and Mass Create Conflicting Goals   While information about the supplier level sizing loop process at others suppliers was not available to   the author  it is reasonable to presume that other suppliers and teams followed a similar one  To the   Spirit team s knowledge the OEM set a cadence  about once a quarter  for all supplier teams to   regularly submit their updated designs to its central database  When all teams have submitted their   designs  the OEM runs its global finite element model  This generates an updated set of loads on each   component that the OEM distributes to suppliers for the process to begin again  The OEM chose its   cadence of once a quarter to give suppliers sufficient time to update designs to meet requirements and   26

before a new set of loads arrived  While the enterprise s expectation was that these   loads would stabilize  with smaller changes in each iteration  many loads oscillated more than expected   even late in the program    At first blush one might assume that the several changes to the structural loads on Spirit s component   were driven by changes to external structural loads on the airframe  but they were not  In a group   interview  several engineering leads at Spirit observed that  overall  aircraft  loads are generally stable   and converged quickly but interface loads are much less mature   They essentially meant that even   though all the forces acting on the airframe were well defined early in the development process  the   distribution of those forces throughout the airframe s components still oscillated even late in the   development process  This happened because this distribution of forces both affects and is affected by   the ongoing changes suppliers make to component designs in trying to meet stress requirements and   mass targets  These design changes change the loads between components without affecting overall   loads on the aircraft  Such oscillation in a system with stable external inputs suggests it might be   treated as a dynamic system with time delays    2 5 4  Loop Gain   Control theory describes how dynamic systems with time delay are managed to achieve desired   outcomes  Under control theory  goal seeking negative feedback loops like the sizing loop either   periodically or continuously compare a system s current output against its desired output  sending a   control signal to the system to adjust system parameters to decrease the gap between the current and   target output  often in proportion to the size of the gap  The enterprise sizing loop periodically samples   its output by running the global finite element model  and the suppliers  sizing loops sample their   outputs by running local stress models    The parameter that determines the relative amplitude of the control signal  is the loop gain and ranges   from 0 to 1 0  A system with high loop gain adjusts its state toward its target state more quickly or   forcefully than a system with low loop gain  In the sizing loop the intuitively attractive loop gain is 1 0    meaning that engineers want to immediately remove all the discrepancy between current designs and   the ideal design  According to interviews with Spirit engineers  loop gain is high in both the enterprise   and supplier sizing loops  Spirit engineers make changes intended to bring safety factors as close to 1 0   as possible in each iteration of the supplier sizing loop  indicating high loop gain  and other supplier   engineers likely do the same  Similarly  each supplier tends to iterate through the supplier sizing loop   until the component design both meets stress requirements and is relatively optimized for mass as   measured by the safety factor parameters discussed earlier  Currently suppliers aim to submit designs   with all safety factors above 1 0 and below 1 05 or 1 10    27    OEM expectations reinforce this aggressive standard  Its general policy is to run the global finite   element model quarterly  with the expectation that after receiving loads updates  suppliers optimize   designs to this standard in that time before submitting them  One might presume that the time to run   the global finite element model might be a limiting constraint  either that it was already being run as   frequently as possible or that resources to run it were so expensive it was desirable to minimize   iterations  According to an email from an OEM representative  neither is true  In fact  the OEM   indicated that its finite element model can typically provide results within a matter of hours  The   primary reason for quarterly sizing loop iterations is instead a fear of injecting chaos into the process by   releasing new load updates before suppliers have finished updating designs in response to the most   recent set  This philosophy is consistent with Braha and Bar Yam s observation that designs fail to   converge when the rate at which tasks are affected by neighboring changes exceeds the task s internal   completion rate  2007     2 6  Summary   This chapter has introduced the context in which the symptomatic design and problem solving   oscillations occurred  The aircraft program studied fits an increasingly common business model of risk   sharing extended enterprise partnerships for new aircraft product development that effectively   decentralize product development effort across several firms  In addition  the program aggressively   seeks to improve the aircraft s fuel efficiency while quickly bringing the aircraft to market  The chapter   reviewed several important challenges of working with new composite materials technology and   outlined the method by which aerospace engineers attempt to balance between stress requirements   and the goal to minimize mass    The following two chapters discuss what these facts say about where the airframe and the enterprise fit   within the frameworks of product development and enterprise architecture theory  Chapter three   presents the relevant product development theory and identifies the spaces the product and enterprise   occupy in their respective architectural dimensions  With this identification it also describes recognized   behaviors associated with products and enterprises occupying similar positions  Chapter four explains   how the enterprise architecture is misaligned with the inherent product architecture  and how the   combined behaviors of each can be expected to generate the symptomatic design and problem solving   oscillations    28    3  Misalignment of Product Architecture and Enterprise Architecture   This chapter introduces theories of product and enterprise architecture and characterizes the airframe   and enterprise in the relevant dimensions of each  It explains behavioral characteristics of the product   and enterprise architectures in use for the program  with anecdotal illustrations of the same    3 1  Product

capabilities  combined with the   available technology  define a frontier of performance in these dimensions and programs trade   performance in each dimension on that frontier  Balancing these kinds of performance is a common   source of tension between program management and engineers because each group tends  because of   its domain knowledge and responsibilities  to focus on one or two more than the other    Schedule pressures motivate the enterprise to finish design definition quickly and the cost of tooling   motivates it to avoid later design updates  At the same time  the need for an optimized design that   meets a difficult and conflicting set of stress and mass requirements drives the enterprise to keep trying   to get a better solution  In this case  the need for refinement has won out so far and the schedule has   slipped significantly  In the words of one advisor to this thesis   Engineers want it better   Program    managers want it Friday  As long as there are iterations  engineers will try to make it better and Friday   will never come     The product and enterprise architectures implemented to develop the aircraft strongly influence   product performance and the cost and length of development  In general  integrated product   architectures and enterprise architectures offer better product performance  while modular   architectures offer shorter development time and lower cost  Product architecture also influences the   appropriate management style  Ulrich and Eppinger assert that in the detailed design phase  managers   of modular products should be most concerned with  ensuring that the teams assigned to chunks    modules  are meeting the performance  cost  and schedule requirements for their chunks  while   managers of integrated products must focus more on integration  conflict resolution  and coordination    2004   Anecdotal evidence suggests that the OEM s management style for this program more closely   matches Ulrich and Eppinger s prescription for modular products than their prescription for integrated   ones  Spirit interviewees described an intense OEM focus on component performance  cost and   schedule requirements and comparatively less focus on resolution of conflicts between component   designs    A mismatch between the product architecture and the product development enterprise architecture   might lead to worse performance on all three performance fronts  Integrated enterprises developing   29    modular products might end up costing more than necessary while still taking a long time  Extended   enterprises developing inherently integrated products are likely to face delays and cost overruns as they   try to bring product performance to acceptable levels  The latter scenario matches the symptoms of the   case at hand    3 2  Airframe Product Architecture   Product architectures define how a product s functions are allocated among its components    Architectures are typically defined along a spectrum from highly integrated to highly modular  Modular   architectures discretely allocate functions among components  while components in integrated   architectures share functions or perform dual roles  Ulrich   Eppinger  2004   When components   perform multiple functions they must balance between the performance attributes associated with   each role they perform  When they share roles with other components  the shared performance   attributes must be managed jointly to achieve an efficient design    Components that share functions are coupled at their interfaces  Ulrich defines coupled components as   those where a change to one will likely require a change to the other  1995   another term for coupling   is interdependence  Airframe components are inherently coupled because loads transfer across   aerostructure interfaces in both directions  To be fair  some components bear more of certain loads   than others  but components  responses to loads cannot be perfectly isolated and prevented from   propagating part of the load to neighboring components  Like other primarily mechanical systems  the   fact that each side of the interface must thus be matched to the energy transfer across the interface   inherently limits the degree to which modular airframe architectures are feasible  Whitney  2002     Further  the load interactions between components are complex and nonlinear  and therefore difficult   to predict or characterize simply  making the airframe system a complex one    Compared to many other products  modern airframes are highly integrated products aerostructures   are hardly off the shelf components  The question here is the degree of integrality relative to other   commercial aircraft  Modern large commercial aircraft follow the same general architecture and divide   functions among recognized sets of components in similar ways  They are modular to the degree that   the principles that apply to designing major systems like wings  fuselages  or empennages hold from   aircraft to aircraft  Using new composite materials technology changes the rules of the design game   enough that many longstanding principles no longer apply and new ones crop up  suggesting a more   integrated approach than for other aircraft would be appropriate    The degree of performance optimization required also affects the degree of product integrality  Where   complexity and coupling determine the number of interdependencies that exist between components    the pressure to optimize holistic product performance characteristics like fuel efficiency determines the   30    proportion of interdependencies that must be managed  In theory  a high number of interdependencies   between components does not necessarily require that the set be designed with an integrated effort  In   this case  for example  stress requirements set lower limits for component strength  but not upper   limits  Each component could be designed somewhat independently  but would then include   redundant material  Previous generations of aircraft were not designed with the same pressures and   attention to fuel efficiency as the current generation and excess material in structural components was   more acceptable then than now3  This meant that interdependencies which might affect mass did not   require the same degree of attention and control  High complexity and optimization thus create a high   number of interdependencies and degrees of freedom that must be managed  this makes the modern   airframe an inherently integrated product    3 3  Developing Integrated Products   The process of designing integrated products exhibits several well known behaviors  The high number   of interdependencies that must be managed requires significant integration effort and rich   communication between component teams  In addition  the development process is almost always   iterative and includes waves and cascades of changes to component designs  Iteration and change   cascades can make it difficult to make and gauge real progress toward final design definition    3 3 1   Interdependency Management   The combination of complexity and near optimum performance targets create the need to manage a   high number of interdependencies  In early low resolution designs the number of known   interdependencies within and across components is low  But as the design becomes more detailed  the   number of defined design parameters grows and the number of interdependency relationships grows   with it  Given the limited bandwidth for discussion and limited capacity of engineers  attention  actively   managing these relationships becomes increasingly difficult and requires more resources as the design   grows in detail  If the effort and resources for identifying  tracking  and negotiating them does not   keep pace with the growth in relationships  interdependencies that should be managed are likely to get   lost in the proverbial cracks    3 3 2  Complexity Requires Rich Communication   Integrated interfaces have many degrees of freedom for interaction between components while   modular interfaces constrain them  Thus  across modular interfaces  the component relationships are                                                       3 Early aircraft used very modular wing architectures that illustrate simply how they create lower  technical performance  Cloth on the wings created aerodynamic surfaces to generate lift  wooden  struts and metal wires bore structural loads  and a separate tank carried fuel  That architecture weighed  proportionally more than modern integrated wings and the struts and wires in the airstream created  undesirable air resistance     31    simple and well defined  and thus so are technical negotiations  they are thus sometimes called   structured technical dialogue  Henderson   Clark  1990  Clark   Fujimoto  1991  Christensen  1994    Ulrich K  T   1995  Ulrich   Eppinger  2004  Chesbrough   Kusunoki  2001  Baldwin   Clark  2000    Christensen  Verlinden    Westerman  2002   Across integrated interfaces  however  component   relationships are complex and initially ambiguous  Teams negotiating them do not necessarily know in   advance which degrees of freedom they will address or how they interact  The scholars referenced   above call these sorts of negotiations unstructured technical dialogue  That kind of negotiation requires   fast  multidimensional communication so teams can create a high resolution shared understanding of   the issues around the interface    Over many aircraft generations  the interdependencies of metallic aircraft have become well   understood  allowing a kind of collaborative shorthand for discussions  Composite materials  however    introduce new constraints and opportunities that invalidate old assumptions  Issues that had long been   settled for metallic aircraft now must be reopened  demanding additional unstructured dialogue to   work in the new design landscape    3 3 3  Change Cascades and Waves   The many interdependencies of complex integrated products introduce the serious challenge of design   cascades  Change cascades occur when a change to one component or design variable change initiates   a series of other changes  The initial change may introduce or modify constraints that necessitate   changes in other design parameters that depend on the first  For example  consider a scenario where   assembly engineers determined a larger tool than anticipated must be inserted into a hole during   assembly or maintenance  The tool size change may thus necessitate expanding the hole  which may in   turn require additional strengthening material in the vicinity and potentially a host of other changes  If    on the other hand  the assembly engineers had found a smaller tool was feasible  and if that had been   the limiting hole size constraint  a similar cascade might drive the described parameters in the opposite   direction    If interdependencies are not recognized  understood  or managed  unanticipated and uncontrolled   change cascades result  driving new iterations that consume engineering resources in a similarly   unanticipated and uncontrolled fashion  Figure 3 illustrates how changes in one system or component   can require changes elsewhere  setting off a chain reaction of changes that cascade in waves   throughout the product  Components A  B  C  and D are linked by dependency relationships  D depends   on A  B  and C  C depends on A and B  and B depends on C  A change to A that affects those   dependency relationships will generate several waves of changes in D  The tighter the interactions   between components  the higher the likelihood that change are sprawl across components    32    Component A   Δ to A   Component B   Δ to B   Component C   Component D   Δ to C   Δ to C   Δ to D   Δ to D   Δ to D   Time      Figure 3  Changes in integrated systems cause waves of changes elsewhere   Bolting location diagrams provide a concrete example of this phenomenon  These diagrams define   where and how airframe components are bolted together and are at the bottom of the airframe s   dependency food chain  Higher level changes forced engineers to redesign these diagrams several times   over in each design phase  more than any other program review deliverable  Interestingly  the OEM s   integration manager  a widely recognized expert in wing design  had advocated freezing these   configurations early in the program  Such a management move is typically more appropriate for   modular product architectures than for integrated ones  while it would have stabilized the design it   would also have significantly reduced the degrees of freedom for engineers to optimize product   performance    3 3 4  Product Development Iteration   The process of developing any complex product inevitably surfaces conflicts in earlier designs    opportunities to improve on earlier designs  or both  These conflicts and opportunities must be   surfaced and resolved until all component designs converge to mutual compatibility and the system s   performance is acceptable  Product development teams recognize this reality and usually anticipate   some iteration    Here  iteration in the abstract refers to repeating development tasks with new information as part of an   information feedback loop  References to an iteration denote repeating a particular set of tasks to   convert a set of inputs into a set of outputs  This thesis also references iteration scope  by which the   author means the number and costs of tasks that are repeated in an iteration  The level of engineering   analysis detail in these tasks also contributes to iteration scope because it modulates the effort   required  The supplier level sizing loop described earlier is typically a narrow scope iteration and   consumes few resources with each iteration  However  a requirements change affecting several parts of   33    the component design  for example  would require engineers to revise many assumptions and include a   wider set of tasks in responding to the change  expanding the scope of the iteration    Iteration costs can be divided into fixed and variable costs  Fixed costs are those associated with   initiating or performing an iteration regardless of its scope and might include paperwork and meetings   officially initiating a new iteration  effort to coordinate data transfers  and engineering analysis that   must be performed for each iteration  Variable costs  on the other hand  depend predominantly on the   scope of the iteration  For example  if a new iteration cycle requires a few quick tasks to confirm a small   change is acceptable  the variable costs are likely to be small because analysis models will require   minimal reconfiguration for the new analysis  Alternatively  if the iteration involves investigating the   impact of a larger change  variable costs are likely to be much higher  Analysis models might require   significant reconfiguration to reflect new assumptions and it is likely several more and longer tasks   would be required    Software architecture is of particular interest here because software analysis time is a primary   determinant of many task times  If software is structured such that analyses must start from scratch   each time they are run  most or all of the cost is fixed the full analysis must run even for a small   change  Interviews with Spirit engineers suggested the aircraft program s stress analysis software   followed this model  On the other hand  if code is structured so that analyses can test the effect of   small changes by starting from results of a similar design  fixed costs might be lower and variable costs   would scale with the size and nature of the change    The ratio of fixed iteration costs to variable costs strongly influences the enterprise s collective attitude   toward iteration  If fixed costs are low  many frequent iterations are feasible  On the other hand  when   fixed costs are high  enterprises seek to minimize iteration it is perceived as a necessary evil and teams   will try to making as much progress toward the final design as possible during each iteration  This   seems to be the case for the aircraft program  to the degree that one senior engineer at Spirit observed   that in the beginning of the program  there were hopes of achieving a final design with just one sizing   loop iteration    3 3 5  Assessing Product Development Progress   The factors that necessitate iteration make it difficult to calculate the number and scope of iterations   the development process will require  and thus the time to final product definition  Iterations occur   because the team must resolve conflicts and opportunities of which it was initially unaware  Because   conflicts are not known in advance and new ones might be generated with each iteration  neither is the   number of iterations required to resolve them  This uncertainty will tend to raise schedule pressure   because teams do not know how much work remains before scheduled project completion    34    These difficulties predicting the actual number and scope of iterations contribute to a project   management phenomenon often called  the 90  Syndrome   Ford   Sterman  2003   Teams often   discover that as they approach scheduled completion  unanticipated changes and subsequent change   cascades required to reach completion force them into new iterations of work they thought they had   completed  The literature describes this late breaking iteration as  hitherto  undiscovered rework  This   situation is called the 90  Syndrome because so many teams developing complex systems find their   work  almost complete  for as much as half of the actual project time  This drives a cultural wedge   between the engineers who need to ask for more time and resources to bring the product performance   to an acceptable level and the program managers who must abandon the project or watch their   schedules erode and expenses climb    3 4  Enterprise Architectures   The scope of decisions for firms organizing themselves to create value for customers is very broad  its   discussion here focuses primarily on the degree of integrality or modularity in the product development   enterprise architecture and its implications  For the purposes of this work  the most important effect of   integrality or modularity is on the speed and quality of information transactions in the enterprise  Three   interrelated integrality variables that affect these information transactions are outlined here    organizational boundaries  geographic dispersion  and incentive structures    While this thesis uses enterprise to mean the way a collection of firms might organize to create   customer value  a variety of other terms  such as value chain  supply chain  and production network   denote the same intended meaning  The term extended enterprise here is meant to convey a team of   companies that collaborates to create value  in this case by developing a new aircraft for airline   customers    From an organizational perspective  the level of vertical integration in the enterprise characterizes the   integrality of its architecture  It defines how the enterprise s functions are allocated among its various   constituencies  Dyer outlines three kinds or levels of integration in enterprises  vertical integration or   hierarchy  arm s length relationships  and partnerships or alliances  2000   Others describe several other   points on this spectrum  Rosenfield   Beckman  2008   but Dyer s three suffice for present discussion    While Dyer s language focuses on manufacturing  the principles readily extend to product   development  where the inputs are pieces of design information rather than physical components  and   the important transaction and coordination costs relate to exchanges of design information    The aircraft program studied nominally fits the partnership model because of its risk  and profit sharing   contracts  In practice  however  the OEM s relationships with suppliers seem to fall between   partnerships and arm s length relationships  Anecdotal evidence of heavy reliance on contracts to   35    enforce firms  interests suggests low levels of inter firm trust in the enterprise  evoking the arm s   length relationships structure  Restriction of inter supplier collaboration suggests more distant   relationships as well    The second variable defining integrality is geography  Advances in information technology have   facilitated globalization and supply chains are increasingly spread across the world  However  many   enterprises co locate parts of the enterprise  even when those parts span many companies  to facilitate   closer integration  Toyota  for example  strongly encourages its suppliers to locate facilities near the   Toyota facilities they support  Over one thousand Walmart suppliers have established locations near its   Bentonville  AK headquarters to support closer relationships with that major customer  Maestri  2007     Embraer followed this practice in the ERJ 170 190 program described earlier  going so far as to lay the   group s work space out in the shape of the aircraft  with each team s location corresponding to the   location of the parts for which it was responsible  Figueiredo  Silveira    Sbragia  2008     Many engineers for major airframe sections were co located during early product development phases   of the aircraft  This turned out to be expensive  Spirit spent millions more on travel than it had   originally planned to support this co location  During the detailed design phase  product development   teams for each component have been located at their own companies  facilities scattered across the   globe  collaborating primarily via teleconferences and periodic design reviews where supplier program   managers  chief engineers  and other senior engineers represent their firms  Figure 4   Using these   more limited media for collaboration doubtless decreased the speed and richness of technical dialogue   to resolve design conflicts    Figure 4  Inter firm Collaborative Communication Structures in the Program      36    Finally  the structure of incentives can affect communication in the enterprise  It is well known that   entities are more likely to cooperate and share information when incentives are tied to collective   performance than when they are based on individual performance  This enterprise has established   system level incentives for suppliers in the form of profit  and risk sharing  and individual incentives as   mass targets and penalties  How do these affect supplier behavior  Anecdotal evidence from interviews   at Spirit suggest the prospect of mass penalties weighed heavily on engineers  and managers  minds   and that these strongly motivated the team to minimize the mass of its components  Team members   did not seem to feel that aircraft sales or profits were likely to change as a direct result of their   component design and therefore paid less direct attention to any related incentives  This approach to   variable compensation  then would also tend to generate a more decentralized  locally focused   approach to optimizing components rather than the wider airframe or aircraft    The match between product architecture and enterprise architecture is clear  Components in an   integrated product must be highly customized  so vertical integration is attractive because it facilitates   high levels of rich communication at relatively low cost  Modular product architectures lend themselves   more readily to vertically disintegrated  arm s length style OEM supplier relationships because they   require less coordination and allow the OEM to minimize component costs  From the available   information  the enterprise architecture for product development in this program is more modular  or   decentralized  than enterprises for similar aircraft  Thus while the theory suggests an more integrated   product development enterprise is most appropriate  the tremendous cost of developing new aircraft   has forced the OEM to move in the opposite direction by splitting the effort among suppliers    3 5  Working in Decentralized Product Development Enterprises   Decentralizing product development introduces new information transaction costs that tend to either   slow communication or decrease its quality  or both  relative to more integrated or centralized   approaches  For products with modular architectures this is perfectly acceptable because   communication can focus on a relatively small set of parameters  However  degraded communication   can exacerbate the challenges of integrated product development  This section outlines the ways   decentralizing product development enterprises slows communication and reduces its quality    3 5 1  Vertical Disintegration Impedes Communication   Disintegrating the development organization disrupts its sense of shared identity and purpose    lowering trust between teams  The OEM s practice of discouraging suppliers from collaborating directly   with one another  but instead through the OEM as an intermediary  further hampers suppliers  ability   to discuss design decisions with interfacing partners in the rich detail necessary to efficiently develop   highly interdependent components  The familiar childhood game of telephone comes to mind   37    messages must be kept simple to avoid getting garbled  While the OEM s point of contact may have   known the right person at one supplier to address another s questions or concerns  working through   that intermediary can muddle the message  slow follow up discussions  and make discussions less rich    Information may not even reach its intended recipients if it exceeds the integrator s bandwidth as a   communication hub    3 5 2   Intellectual Property Protection Impedes Communication   One direct result of organizational disintegration is that intellectual property must be managed    especially when inter firm trust is low  A July 2010 Aviation Week article observes that one of the key   challenge of this new risk sharing partnership business model is  figuring out how to operate with new   partners while still protecting core customer relationships and technical competencies   4  Wall    Anselmo    Flottau  2010   Companies in the aircraft program are careful to protect their intellectual   property  which delays the sharing of relevant information that must be checked and stripped of   proprietary data before external release    For the program in question  intellectual property management has created some frustrating situations   for both the OEM and its suppliers  For example  when Spirit s team received updates to the OEM s   proprietary software  engineers sometimes discovered unexpected results in its analyses  but Spirit s   engineers could not tell whether the differences were due to user errors  software errors  or just   differences in techniques  and the team could not make design progress until the discrepancies were   resolved  Because the software code had been  locked down  to protect its proprietary algorithms    Spirit s engineers could not study it to determine what caused the unexpected results  When this   occurred they needed to spend weeks working with the OEM s geographically distant software   development team to understand the source of the unexpected results and how to address them  This   protracted effort to resolve software issues distracted from the team s work and delayed its design   updates  effectively slowing the sizing loop    3 5 3  Geographic Dispersion Impedes Communication   Distributing work among geographically dispersed teams introduces new transaction costs to   information transfer between teams  When collaborating teams are dispersed the quality of   information transfers decreases or requires extra effort to reach the same quality  Allen has shown that   even within firms and within buildings  communication drops drastically with geographic distance   between parties  2000   He also observes that technical ideas and problems are difficult to                                                       4 See Appendix D for a discussion of current events illustrating the long term risks to OEMs in risk  sharing partnerships where intellectual property is shared with suppliers    38    communicate verbally  and are much better supported by diagrams and the feedback of non verbal   communication    When aircraft designs were developed entirely by in house  co located teams  the team generally found   it easier to quickly collaborate informally  One senior Spirit engineering manager described a program   earlier in his career at another company where a huge paper diagram of the wing his team was   designing was attached to the wall  When team members needed to discuss or debate an issue they   often walked up to the diagram together to point out and explain the interdependencies that made a   design option a good or bad idea  In contrast  he observed  in the present arrangement engineers   sometimes are not even sure whom they would approach to discuss issues related to interfacing parts   or how to contact them    3 5 4  Local Incentives Impede Communication   When supplier incentives focus on component performance  teams will tend to take a more component   performance centric approach to their work spend less effort to understand the wider system  They will   thus seek out local performance optima in the design space rather than system performance optima  In   addition  situations will inevitably arise where teams are reluctant to cooperate for fear of incurring   penalties or of losing rewards  Component teams are likely to fight against any component change that   reduces their local incentive related performance  even if the change improves overall system   performance  When teams are negotiating interfaces  each will seek a solution that maximizes its own   component s performance  Neither team is likely to reveal all it knows about how much it can afford to    give  at such interfaces  for fear of losing negotiating advantage  Thus when local incentives play a   major role in decisions  negotiations are more likely to devolve into haggling over how to split load   bearing responsibility in the airframe  rather than focusing on the best solution for the airframe  Such   haggling is another transaction cost that delays design convergence    This section has described the ways decentralizing product development effort slows communication   and reduces its quality  meaning its dimensional richness and clarity  throughout the enterprise    Because program development in the program in question is decentralized organizationally and   geographically  and local performance incentives reinforce a locally oriented perspective in component   teams  information sharing between teams is indeed slowed and often lacks the richness engineers   would prefer    3 6  Summary   Chapter three has characterized the airframe in the context of product architecture theory as an   inherently integrated product and the product development enterprise as predominantly decentralized    Each architecture implies a set of system behaviors that affect product development outcomes    39    An integrated product architecture  especially for a complex optimized system  necessitates iterative   development with careful attention to managing interdependencies and resolving design conflicts    Tight coupling between components makes design changes prone to starting cascades of changes and   waves of changes throughout the system  Managing these interdependencies to mitigate change   cascades and control iteration requires rich communication between teams  And even if the enterprise   does all of this well  the iterative nature of the process can make it difficult to gauge the distance to   the finish line  which can raise uncertainty and schedule pressure for the program    Decentralizing the enterprise slows collaborative communication and reduce its quality  Organizational   disjoints reduce trust and slow communication  Intellectual property protection slows information   sharing and leads teams to hold some information back  Geographic dispersion raises the cost of   seeking and sharing information  And local incentives discourage collaboration and instead encourage   teams to focus on component performance and neglect studying deeply how their components   interact with neighboring ones    Where this chapter outlined architecture behaviors separately  chapter four explains the implications of   combining an integrated product architecture with a decentralized enterprise architecture    40    4  Product Development in Misaligned Architectures   The preceding chapter has shown that product development for airframe components should be a   highly integrated effort  However  industry forces  especially the high cost of new product   development  have forced the OEM to distribute the design effort to several suppliers  Decentralization   introduces obstacles to collaborative concurrent engineering  This chapter considers the product   development enterprise behaviors to expect in mismatched architectures and recalls the program s   symptoms consonant with each  Figure 5 illustrates how these phenomena  combined with the   program s schedule pressure and aggressive mass targets  interact to drive design oscillation that   delays design convergence  This chapter explains these interactions in detail  explaining subsections of   this figure in smaller pieces  of which Figure 6 is the first       Figure 5  Causal Loops for Convergence Delay in Misaligned Architectures   4 1 1  Degraded Communication Increases Change Cascades   The earlier discussion of change cascades and waves highlighted the role of design interdependencies   and new technology in driving change cascades  Less rich communication in decentralized enterprises   raises the risk that teams fail to manage design interactions in the narrower negotiations between   41   ConvergenceDelayInterface loadsoscillationamplitudeHigh loopgain factorMax acceptablesafety factorMin

engineers  Communication delays compound this problem with the net effect that teams will base   design decisions on  stale  or incorrect data  necessitating later design revisions  Because some   interdependencies thus go unrecognized and unmanaged  engineers are more likely to generate   conflicting designs that must then be changed in additional iterations when the conflicts are discovered    Figure 6     Figure 6  Degraded communication increases change cascades       The effect of these communication obstacles  were illustrated when Spirit s development team received   several late breaking changes to requirements  such as new constraints on allowable fasteners or new   specifications for dimensional tolerances  They usually required Spirit s team to restart its sizing loop to   make accommodating design changes  Spirit s team often only learned of these changes weeks or   months after they had occurred and through unofficial channels  Some of Spirit s effort in the time   between the requirement s change and Spirit s notification was rendered obsolete because it had been   based on assumptions Spirit should have learned earlier were incorrect    4 1 2  Degraded Communication Slows Iteration   Degraded communication also slows sizing loops by making it take longer to get the right information   and coordinate design changes with other teams  Several interviewees at Spirit shared that when they   were uncertain of what information the OEM really wanted  they sometimes erred by sending too little    and sometimes sent all the information they had  just to be safe  As a result  individuals and teams on   such projects often find themselves waiting for critical data  or at the other extreme  wading through   floods of data to find the information they want to use  This is part of what contributed  for example    for delays that kept Spirit s team from learning of changed requirements in a timely manner    4 1 3  Degraded Communication Increases Loop Gain   Lower dimensional communication between teams will tend to decrease teams  senses of   connectedness between their components and will lead them to assume input information from other   teams is more stable than it actually is  This makes it seem reasonable to spend significant time and   effort in each sizing loop optimizing the design against current inputs because those inputs are not   expected to change or affect the design  Figure 7   In effect  this makes high loop gain seem feasible    the aircraft program s early hopes of just one sizing loop indicate this may have been the case here    42   ChangecascadesIterationsrequired  Communicationquality   Communicationspeed      Figure 7  Low Communication Quality Increases Loop Gain and Slows Iteration   4 1 4  Schedule Pressure Increases Loop Gain   Again treating the product development enterprise as a dynamic system  the pressure to achieve final   design definition quickly makes higher loop gain more attractive  In trying to accomplish more with   each iteration  teams tended to spend extra time optimizing the design  trying to get it as close to its   stress and mass targets as possible  The OEM has reinforced this behavior by requiring optimized   designs that meet stress requirements and mass targets throughout the design process  The combined   effects of new technology  complex nonlinear interactions within components  and slowed   communication mean it takes longer for suppliers in this program to optimize designs in each sizing   loop iteration than in the past  Spending additional time to optimize designs for each sizing loop   iteration increases the time between global finite element model simulations by which teams learn of   updated loads on their components  Figure 8     43   High loopgain factorSizing looptimes CommunicationqualityPerceived componentindependence      Figure 8  Aggressive Time to Market Increases Loop Gain and Slows Iteration   4 1 5   Increased Loop Gain and Sizing Loop Times Drive Oscillation   Increasing loop gain makes suppliers try harder to perfect designs with each sizing loop iteration    Ceteris paribus this means designs change more in each iteration than if suppliers aimed for a lower   standard  In addition  however  it takes longer to do so  increasing the time each supplier can spend   before submitting design updates  The OEM s current policy is to wait for updates from each supplier    meaning that  fast  suppliers have more time to optimize while they wait for the slowest suppliers to   bring their designs to the standard for submission  This tends to mean that faster suppliers  designs will   change even more between enterprise sizing loop iterations    A thermostat example illustrates how loop gain and the frequency with which the system output is   sampled can affect system oscillation  Imagine a thermostat with upper and lower temperature   thresholds  if the thermostat detects the temperature is above the upper threshold it will send a signal   to cool the room while if the temperature is below the lower threshold it will send a signal to heat the   room  Next assume the thermometer controls a heat pump with adjustable heating and cooling power    and that the room is also affected to a lesser degree by other sources of heat and cold that the   thermostat cannot control  The thermostat sets the heat pump s power in proportion to the gap   between the sampled room temperature and either the minimum or maximum temperature threshold    as appropriate  Finally assume that this thermometer only measures room once temperature every   fifteen minutes    44   High loopgain factorMax acceptablesafety factorMin acceptablesafety factorSizing looptimes Schedulepressure  Systemcomplexity non

the upper temperature threshold  when the thermostat   next samples the temperature it will send a signal for the heat pump to start cooling the room at low   power  Now the room is cooled by the heat pump for fifteen minutes  If this brings the temperature   back within the temperature thresholds  the thermostat turns the heat pump off and the temperature   remains stable  Figure 9     Temperature

cooled below the lower temperature threshold  In this case the   thermostat next switches the heat pump to heat the room for the next fifteen minutes  At the end the   temperature will probably be above the upper threshold again  causing another signal to cool  and the   temperature will thus waste energy by oscillating  Figure 10     45    Temperature   Temperature Oscillation   0  60  120

the lower   threshold than it was above the upper threshold  Now the heating power is even stronger than the   cooling power was and the room gets even hotter than before  In this circumstance the temperature   swings will continue to oscillate with increasing amplitude until they reach the limit of the heat pump s   power  Figure 11     Temperature   Unstable Temperature Control   0  60  120  180  Time  minutes    Current Temp  Min Threshold  Max Threshold  Sample temp  Figure 11  Unstable Temperature Control   This example illustrates how loop gain  delays  and requirement thresholds can interact to cause   instability and oscillation in goal seeking feedback loops that would normally converge to a stable   46          result between thresholds  Specifically  if the band between thresholds is small enough that during the   period between system output sampling  the loop gain causes the system output to move from outside   one threshold to outside the other  the system output will oscillate  What will decrease the oscillation    Sampling the system state more frequently yields smaller changes between samples  which helps   mitigate oscillation  Reducing loop gain  the proportional response to the gap between the current   output and the relevant threshold  also yields smaller changes during each sampling period  Finally    widening the band between thresholds has a double positive effect  First  larger changes are required   for the system output to swing from one threshold to another  reducing the likelihood of overshoot   and second  if the output does overshoot the threshold  the gap between the output and the threshold   are smaller  reducing the effective loop gain    There are analogs to each of these variables in the actual aircraft program s sizing loop  Sampling the   room temperature is like running a stress model to determine whether all safety factors are   acceptable the longer the delay between samples the greater the opportunity for designs to change    The temperature thresholds correspond to the upper and lower safety factor thresholds the narrower   the band of acceptable safety factors the greater the risk that corrective adjustments will overshoot the   threshold band  The power of the heat pump is analogous to the proportional response by engineers   when safety factors fall outside relevant thresholds trying to get the design  perfect  at each sizing   loop iteration represents high loop gain while a more incremental approach corresponds to lower loop   gain    4 1 6  Design Oscillations   The goal seeking behavior of the sizing loop is intended to cause the system output to settle as it   approaches its goal  But the earlier thermostat example shows that this can fail for reasons that exist in   the aircraft program s sizing loop  High loop gain means component designs generally change more   drastically in a given time period than in loops with lower gain  Combined with longer sizing loops  this   means each component design tends to change more with each loop  Larger component changes   mean larger changes to interface loads when the global finite element models runs  When updated   loads are released to suppliers  component teams try to adjust their designs toward the new apparent   optima and tend to collectively overshoot the true optimum and have to adjust in the opposite   direction in later iterations  the essence of design oscillation  Figure 12 illustrates how these factors   interact to increase the amplitude of design and loads changes with each iteration    47       Figure 12  Narrow Acceptable Safety Factor Bands Increase Design and Loads Oscillation   4 1 7  Delayed Design Convergence   Final design definition occurs when all components designs are compatible and the whole product   meets performance criteria  Design oscillations delay convergence    One might ask whether the enterprise is at least making progress toward final product definition    Browning  et al  argue that   making progress and adding value  to the customer  in complex system   product development equate with producing useful information that reduces performance risk   2000     In other words  the enterprise only makes real progress by reducing the risk that the final product will   not meet its performance criteria  and it cannot do that unless it is actually converging on a final   design  The corresponding metric for progress  then  is the hopefully decreasing amplitude of design   oscillations  assuming those designs meet performance requirements  High amplitude oscillations   suggest most of the enterprise s effort is waste that does not really contribute to convergence    And yet each part of the enterprise is working as hard as it can to do just that  Browning et al  explain   how their efforts generate undesired results    in many cases  lack of value stems less from doing   unnecessary activities and more from doing necessary activities with the wrong information  and then   having to redo them    2002   The potential accusation that suppliers  weren t doing their jobs  is only   partly true  Suppliers put forth heroic efforts doing all the right tasks  but with the wrong   information wrong because it was immature  Given loads data was very immature and subject to   wide swings  teams spent unjustified effort in optimizing against those inputs  albeit at the OEM s   insistence    What management policies can prevent the enterprise from exhausting its time or resources before   converging to a final design  One option is to relax technical requirements such as mass targets so that   a less optimal design is acceptable  In fact sometimes the initial performance targets are infeasible and   48   Interface loadsoscillationamplitudeHigh loopgain factorMax acceptablesafety factorMin acceptablesafety factorDesign changeamplitude periterationSizing looptimes       ultimately require design relief  as it is known in the industry  to achieve convergence  Another option   is to provide additional resources or slip the final schedule to allow the enterprise additional time to   iterate toward convergence  Given the program s objectives  both of these approaches are decidedly   undesirable    4 2  Options to Improve Performance   What can the enterprise change to reduce its design oscillations and converge earlier on an acceptable   solution  especially if the two most obvious changes  reverting to a vertically integrated product   development approach and co locating all the development teams  are off the table  Mihm et al    suggest six strategies for reducing design oscillations in complex engineering projects        Limit system size        Modularize the system  making components less interdependent         Ignore some interdependencies        Optimize large sets of components rather than the full system        Broadcast design updates  or      Release preliminary information about component designs  2003     Limiting the system size will not work  that would prevent the aircraft from meeting fundamental   customer requirements for passenger capacity  The airframe also cannot be dramatically more modular   because sharing loads across components is fundamental to its function  Nor can many   interdependencies be ignored because that would prevent the design from optimizing fuel efficiency    Mihm et al  s fourth suggestion is already in place  the airframe is already divided into large groups of   components  e g  fuselage  wing  etc  that are managed as major systems    The remaining two recommendations revolve around process architecture changes to share design   information more frequently across the enterprise  While Mihm et al  distinguish between   disseminating design updates and preliminary design information  they amount to the same thing in   iterative design  Practically speaking  this boils down to running the global finite element more   frequently to update suppliers  loads information    Braha and Bar Yam make a similar suggestion  They have shown in a statistical model that improving   the speed of central tasks  i e  those with relatively many inputs and outputs  will tend to drastically   alter overall performance  Braha   Bar Yam  2007   The most central task in the sizing loop is running   the global finite element model it takes all component designs as inputs and its outputs affect all   component designs  However  the model s speed is not the loop s limiting factor  so improving its   performance alone is unlikely to significantly reduce time to convergence  The length of sizing loops is   49    instead determined by the time required for suppliers to update their designs to the OEM s standards   and by the OEM s policy to run the model when all suppliers have submitted updates    All of this suggests that the OEM should run the global finite element model more frequently  It also   indicates that suppliers  design updates should be incorporated more frequently into the global model    well before they meet standards for the final design  The OEM can facilitate the latter step by relaxing   its standards for design updates  The following chapter sections outline practical implementations of   this suggestion    4 2 1  Sample the System State More Frequently   In the current system  the long delays between loads updates tend to make changes to loads relatively   large  It also means that much of engineers  is work is based on stale  out of date input data  It would   help engineers if swings in loads were smaller  more frequent loads updates tend to reduce the   amplitude of swings    Program leaders could explicitly change program policy for when to run the global model  The current   policy is to run the global model about every twelve weeks  expecting suppliers to submit design   updates between each iteration  An alternative strategy is to run the global model and disseminate   loads when a smaller fraction of suppliers have submitted design updates  The upside to such a change   is that suppliers will receive more frequent loads updates  which will prevent them from collectively   overshooting the true optimum as they make design updates or at least reduce the overshoot    There is a risk  however  that the updates will consistently arrive before some teams have acceptably   responded to the previous loads set  If updates come too quickly they will be overwhelmed and unable   to submit design updates in response to the changes  Braha and Bar Yam s model finds that   product   development  network dynamics will converge unless the total rate at which a task is affected by its   neighboring tasks exceeds the  internal completion rate  of the task   2007   For this thesis research   their conclusion suggests that unless suppliers can respond to load updates before they receive more   load updates  their designs will fail to converge  Practically  this might mean overwhelmed suppliers   would simply stop work until the rate of inputs changes decreased below that threshold  Spirit   engineers agreed  suggesting that if updates came too frequently they would be tempted to wait until   things had settled down before working on those inputs    The actual implications of this policy change bear investigation  If suppliers generally complete design   updates at the same rate  the likelihood that any one will be consistently overwhelmed is low  even   though each will be temporarily  left behind  on occasion  It is also possible that one or more suppliers   are always playing  catch up  because they consistently require more time than others to bring their   50    designs to the standard for submission  In this case the changes other suppliers make might still allow   a final design that meets stress and mass requirements    4 2 2  Widen the Band of Acceptable Safety Factors   Another practical approach to lowering loop gain is to widen the set of acceptable safety factors for   design updates by decreasing the minimum acceptable safety factor  raising the maximum  or both    While the final design would still have to meet stringent safety factor requirements  intermediate   designs would not  This will tend to both lower loop gain and shorten the time duration of the sizing   loop  It will lower loop gain as a multiplier because designs will not have to change as much in each   iteration to reach an acceptable design  It will shorten sizing loops because teams will generally require   less time to update designs when update submission requirements are looser  One sophisticated   approach to this is simulated annealing  Kirkpatrick  1984   by which initially loose requirements are   methodically narrowed such that design parameters become more rigid over time  Such an approach   here would set wide initial acceptable safety factor bands and narrow the band in a disciplined fashion   over the course of the development effort  This thesis takes a simpler approach by simply adjusting the   static band of acceptable safety factors for iteration    4 3  Summary   This chapter has shown how misalignment of product and enterprise architectures for this aircraft   program  combined with its aggressive mass and schedule targets  generate design oscillations that   drive loads oscillations that delay final design definition  It outlines several theoretical methods to   reduce this oscillation  most of which are infeasible for the program  The most attractive of the   remaining options is to change program policies to facilitate more frequent information sharing and   smaller design changes between enterprise sizing loop iterations    The following chapters describe the simulation game the author used to test the hypothesis that these   changes reduce oscillation and shorten design convergence time  and the results of those simulations    51    5  Simulation Game Approach   Lowering loop gain by making smaller changes between each global model evaluation might sound to   program leaders like slowing down  This makes it a counterintuitive approach to accelerating product   development and program leaders might dismiss it  especially if it conflicts with their experience and   intuition  Instead they might attribute the team s challenges to the simple fact that aircraft are complex   products and composite materials are a challenging new technology  A credible demonstration of an   alternative strategy s effectiveness is critical to motivating its implementation    Directly experimenting with changes to the product development strategy in such a large and complex   aircraft program is infeasible  Instead  this thesis presents a simulation exercise game with a design   challenge patterned after the program s product development environment and structure  The game is   used as both an educational tool and a framework for automated agent based simulation  It is   designed to simulate the product development environment with sufficient fidelity to credibly   demonstrate the simulation s applicability to real life while remaining simple enough to make cause   and effect readily visible to simulation participants and to make it tractable for automated simulation    Chapters 5 through 8 explain this approach and its results   Specifically  Chapter 5 briefly summarizes   the approach and explains the design of the game  including the simplified structure that players and   simulated agents work on   Chapter 6 explains the actions available to the agents   Chapter 7 presents   the results of experiments using the agents while Chapter 8 presents the results of people playing the   game    Scholars have developed games and  management flight simulators  to facilitate learning in and about   complex dynamic systems5  Sterman  1994   The most widely known example is the Beer Distribution   Game created by a group of MIT Sloan professors to illustrate supply chain management challenges  As   educational tools  these simulation games help participants better understand the systems in which   they work and their roles in them by reducing their complexity and time scale to bring cause and   effect into clearer focus  Simulation games also create a low stakes environment to discuss the issues   and behavior patterns defending one s behavior    The product development simulation game developed for this project has several objectives        First  it provides the framework for an automated agent based simulation to evaluate a variety   of management policies to reduce loop gain  many of which significantly improve results        Second  it clarifies the strategies engineers intuitively pursue in this basic product development   structure                                                        5 See the cited paper for a more detailed list of simulation games and exercises    52        Third  it confirms that the human participants pursuing their intuitive strategies generate game   system behaviors similar to those observed in the actual product development system        Fourth  it is a learning tool to help participants understand why their natural approaches   produce undesirable results and what they can do to improve results        Finally  it demonstrates that when human participants pursue the improved strategies   illustrated by the strict agent based simulation  they similarly achieve significantly improved   results    After developing the game framework  in order to test the initial game design and evaluate alternative   strategies with more and faster iterations than human simulation could allow  the author adapted it to   accommodate automated simulations with virtual players called agents  This allowed the author to   conduct several virtual rounds of the game before humans played  The author modeled the agents    decision rules for the game to approximate the aircraft program s current policies  as described in   interviews with engineers  In this automated simulation  design parameters oscillated  which delayed   design convergence  echoing the aircraft program s symptoms    Next  the author separately tested the effect of three policy changes       Reducing the number of design update submissions required before running the global model         Lowering the lower bound of acceptable safety factors for a design submission  and       Raising the upper bound of acceptable safety factors for a design submission    Finding that all three policy changes reduce design oscillation and decreased the time to convergence   in the simulation  the author also tested a combination of all three changes and found that together   they reduce convergence time even more    After these agent based simulations  the author facilitated two instances of the game with human   participants  with each of the two teams playing two rounds  In the first rounds  participants were free   to pursue intuitive strategies  design oscillations which delayed convergence occurred in every case  A   pre game survey of participants and participants  comments during and after the first round of the   game provide clarifying insights about the intuitive strategies participants pursued  These generally   matched the policies described by engineers for the program in question    After a discussion of the causes and potential remedies to oscillation in the first round  participants   played the game again with a revised strategy to implement the three policy changes that were tested   in agent based simulation  As in the automated simulations  the amplitude of design oscillations   dramatically decreased and so did convergence time  After the human simulation games  the author   updated the agent based model to better match human participants  behavior and to enable clearer   53    illustration of the observed phenomena  These changes primarily focused on the time required for   agents to take each of the possible steps and on slight adjustments to their decision rules  New   simulations with the updated agent based model demonstrate the same behaviors under the cited   strategies    5 1  Game Design   The game designed for this project incorporates the process and information structure of the sizing   loop described earlier and the pressures that the OEM and supplier firms face in this program  It mimics   the structure of actual processes  incentives  constraints  data flow paths  and feedback data  Table 1   summarizes how the simulation game is

design an optimized  but relatively simple cantilever truss    Figure 13  with a predetermined set of loads applied at its joints6  The truss is described as the   structure for the wings of the fictional Wright Flyer III airplane7  It should be as light and thin as   possible without exceeding a maximum stress threshold in any member  as long as it meets stress   requirements  the lighter the truss the more trusses the team sells  The team also sells more trusses if it   completes development quickly than if it does not  These objectives mirror the program s goals to meet   stress requirements  minimize mass  and finish design definition quickly  Before running these   simulations the author determined the true optimum design  the lowest mass configuration that still   meets stress requirements  and was therefore able to compare final designs to the true optimum       Figure 13  Design Game Truss   Three participants play the role of suppliers designing their respective sections of the truss  an inboard   section  outboard section  and a covers section  illustrations in this and following chapters abbreviate   these as IS  OS  and CS  respectively  Some members of each section overlap members of another   section they connect the same pair of joints of the truss and thus directly share load bearing   functions with those of another section  This mimics the actual aircraft program where overlapping                                                       6 While loads are known to the game facilitator  the applied loads at truss joints are not revealed to  game players  However  the net load for each of a section s joints  which combines applied loads and  current interface loads  is shown to the corresponding section design player   7 Appendix A is the scenario introduction given to game participants before playing the game    55    components similarly share load bearing functions  In the game  the effective thickness of the truss   between joints connected by overlapping members is the sum of their thicknesses  Each of the   overlapping members bears the load in proportion to its thickness relative to the combined thicknesses   of both members  Thus  if the inboard section s CD member has a thickness of 200 and the outboard   section s CD members has a thickness of 100  the combined thickness is 300 and the inboard section s   CD member bears two thirds of the load between joints C and D while the outboard section s CD   member bears one third of the load    The distribution of mass in the final truss design is equitable if overlapping truss members bear the   load between their shared joints equally  For example  if the true optimum thickness for the two   overlapping members connecting joints C and D is 300  this could be achieved in any configuration   where inboard and outboard CD members  thicknesses sum to 300  However  the mass is distributed   most equitably if the load is shared equally if each member s thickness is 150   Comparisons of   thickness values against optimal thickness values assume that if the member in question overlaps   another member  that in the true optimum configuration the overlapping members have equal   thickness and thus bear their shared load equally    The section design players  work is to adjust truss member thicknesses  checking safety factors via a   local stress model  and to submit design updates to the integrator player  This thesis frequently   abbreviates  section design player  as SDP  The fourth player  the integrator  mimics the OEM s role by   running a global stress model on the whole truss as section designs are updated and disseminating   updated loads for the sections  local stress models  Figure 14 shows how information flows in the   game between all the participants and their stress analysis models          Figure 14  Information Flows in the Design Game   56    Figure 15 shows the tasks that constitute the sizing loops in the

using separate sheets for the user interface and the   various calculations  Using Google Documents also allows several participants to simultaneously adjust   their designs  a necessary feature for simulation of concurrent engineering    The truss is intentionally more tightly coupled than the actual aerostructures in question to compensate   for the simplicity of the its structure and to ensure the effects of the interdependencies are quickly and   powerfully felt during game play  In the real product  the thickness and geometry of each small area   significantly and directly affect not only the stresses in that area but in the surrounding ones  However    the impact on distant areas is small and indirect  Viewed as a network of dependency relationships   57    between parts of each component  the network representing the actual system would be sparse   overall  even if it were dense in each area s immediate vicinity  In contrast  the network for the game s   truss is denser  meaning each component is connected to a higher proportion of other components   than in the real system  As a result  each part of the truss affects and is affected by a higher proportion    but not a higher number  of other parts of the system  Figure 16 shows illustrative examples   contrasting these two situations  the examples to not reflect the actual dependency relationships    The network

the thicknesses of   truss members  In the actual components there are many parameters to adjust  variables with complex    nonlinear interrelationships  Engineers can do wonders to reduce component mass and improve   performance by adjusting geometries and other variables in much more complex ways than adjusting   truss member thicknesses    5 1 2  Stress Analysis and Feedback   The fundamental engineering analysis of the game is stress analysis of the truss and its sections  In real   airplane design  stress analysis is a computationally intensive activity  Companies often use   supercomputers to analyze finite element models of the design  Fortunately much simpler approaches   are readily available for analyzing simple trusses like the one in the game  The game analyzes stress   using the direct stiffness method  This method treats each member of the structure as a spring   governed by Hooke s law and uses linear algebra to closely approximate stresses in the truss  This   method is the computational basis for most finite element analysis software  though most packages   add significant sophistication    58    Whenever a SDP runs his or her local stress model or the integrator player runs the global stress model   the spreadsheet reports the safety factors for each truss member in that player s model  Players use   safety factor values to determine whether truss members need to be thicker or thinner    5 1 3  Performance Measurement   The game s primary performance metric for human players is profit  In the game scenario  several   customers have pre ordered the truss contingent on the final design falling below a customer specified   mass threshold and final product definition occurring before a specified time  These requirements   create parallel pressures to minimize final product mass and time to market that the program actually   faces  The values for these requirements were generated as uncorrelated normal distributions  Figure   17 shows the mass and completion time requirements for each order  An additional requirement    ostensibly from a regulatory agency  specifies the maximum allowable stress in any truss member in   order for the product to be sold  Orders to the left of the solid green line are infeasible because they   fall below the lowest possible mass that meets stress requirements  This is intentional and reflects the   fact that some customers  expectations may be infeasible  Orders to the left of the dashed green line   fall above the optimal mass but below the target mass that is 4  above optimal

Mass  Infeasible  Optimum Feasible Mass  Target Completion Time     Figure 17  Game Truss Pre Orders   The distribution of completion deadlines is calibrated so that most orders fall between 40 virtual weeks   and 80 virtual weeks  One virtual week passes every 40 seconds  so in game play this range corresponds   to a range from 26 6 minutes to 53 3 minutes in real time  There is no inherent lower bound to   59    completion time  game participants could make lucky early guesses and finish the design quickly    However  prototype testing of the simulation indicated that completion deadlines earlier than about 40   virtual weeks are optimistic    Integrator players earn a fixed amount for each truss sold  using it to pay SDPs and retaining the rest as   profit  The integrator pays SDPs a fixed amount for each truss sold  less mass penalties or plus mass   incentives  based on mass targets assigned to each section  As in reality  if the section s mass is above   the target value  its supplier is penalized in proportion to the amount by which it exceeds the target   mass  If the section s mass is below the target value  its designer receives a smaller incentive payment   also in proportion to the difference between target and actual mass  In the game  the mass target for   each section is set to four percent above its optimal mass  Players are not told how their targets relate   to the true optimum because in actual aircraft design suppliers never know how their mass targets   relate to the optimal design s mass    5 1 4   Initial Conditions   Participants begin the game with a static set of loads applied to the truss and an initial design wherein   all members are within 26  of their true optimum thickness value  Table 2   Static loads were   determined randomly and initial thicknesses were randomly selected from normal distributions about   the optimum thicknesses  but these initial values were constant for all simulation     Table 2

in his or her section        Submit the current design to the integrator       Run the local stress model to calculate safety factors based on section thicknesses and current   loads       Write a message to the integrator       After the integrator runs the global model  SDPs receive notification that updated loads on   their section joints are available and may retrieve them as soon thereafter as they wish    The integrator may also take any one of several actions       Run the global stress model  which incorporates the all submitted section designs  Upon   completion of the global model  all SDPs are immediately notified that new loads are available        Set upper or lower bounds to one or more thickness parameters  This is equivalent to   instituting a design freeze on certain parameters or constraining them arbitrarily       Adjust the maximum or minimum safety factors expected of designs before submission       Adjust the target completion time  This has no effect on customer orders  but communicates an   expected completion time to SDPs       Write a message to a SDP    The integrator player can always see the total profits and number of sales it would achieve if the design   were finalized at the present time and mass and at the target time and mass  The integrator player can   also find out at any time what sales and profits would be if final design occurred a player specified   number of virtual weeks after the present time or at the current time with a player specified percent   61    change from the current mass  This provides the integrator player a method to evaluate  after the   design meets stress requirements  the tradeoff between ending the game to lock in sales with   approaching deadlines or to delay completion in hopes of reducing mass to capture additional sales    Finally  data logging occurs in the background during game play  Each time a player executes an action    JavaScript code records the action taken and all key system parameters  such as section masses  truss   member thicknesses  and safety factors  at the time the action was taken  This data is used to examine   the patterns of behavior in game play and to support post mortem discussion of the game among   participants    5 2  Summary   A simulation game mimicking important features of the actual program allows experimentation with   alternative strategies to accelerate design convergence  This chapter has presented the game s structure   and shows how it mirrors the actual aircraft program in question  Like an actual aircraft program  this   game challenges participants to optimize the design of an inherently integrated product while working   in a decentralized fashion  The research hypothesis is that design oscillations and consequent delays   will occur as a result of the actions taken by human game participants working under their intuitive   strategies and by software agents mimicking current aircraft program policies  and that these   oscillations will mimic those seen in actual aircraft programs    After developing the game  the author prepared an agent based simulation model to identify strategies   most likely to reduce convergence time  As suggested by earlier discussion  these simulations focused   on increasing the frequency of global model iterations and widening the band of acceptable safety   factors for design submission  Both of these changes demonstrate dramatic reduction in convergence   time in the simulation  and improve it even more when combined  To confirm these results  the game   was next run with human participants  groups of senior engineers at Spirit  In the first round of the   game  in which they pursued their own intuitive strategies  the groups experienced design oscillation   that delayed convergence as expected  During the second round of the game  they implemented the   combined policy changes of running the global model more frequently and widening the band of   acceptable safety factors for submission  Their results mirrored the dramatic improvement in the agent   based simulation results the design oscillated much less and therefore converged much more quickly    62    6  Agent Based Simulation   In this context an agent is a logical construct within a software program that interacts with its   environment and other agents according to local information and predefined decision rules or policies    In this application  agents take the place of each player in the game  Agents in the game use the   predefined rules and thresholds to evaluate the information available in their role and determine which   actions to take next  The two types of agents match the two types of game players  integrator agents   and section design agents  the latter are abbreviated here as SDAs  After each round of the game  the   simulation program records the results and then updates agents  rule sets for the next round  This   approach can quickly simulate thousands of game sessions faster and with fewer resources than   human simulations    Agent based simulation cannot capture the full complexity of actions taken by humans in the same   context  Humans  for example  adjust their policies and thresholds over time as they observe trends in   the process or as their mental models of the process change  Some agent based models allow agents   to adjust their rules over time but the agents built for this simulation do not  Humans also sometimes   make decisions that would not appear to fit within any clear rule set  For these reasons  agent based   simulations can help evaluate the general effectiveness of a strategy  strictly followed  but do not   perfectly model the more sophisticated and unpredictable decisions of human players    6 1  Designing the Simulation Environment   The agent simulation environment matches the human simulation environment as closely as feasible    As in the human centered simulation  the game facilitator initializes a clock when the agent team   begins its work  Each possible agent action is assigned an adjustable duration parameter in order to   reflect the time that human players must spend on various actions and the real task times of actual   development work  Whenever an agent takes an action  it is not eligible to take any other actions until   the time for the current action has passed  Action times are tracked on individual agent clocks so that    following the pattern of human gameplay  agent s actions do not consume other agents  time    After each agent action  the simulation program randomly  to prevent deterministic simulations  selects   a possible action that an integrator or SDA might take  The program checks whether the selected action   is eligible for execution  Eligibility is based on whether current conditions meet the logical tests for   eligibility and the time of the agent s last action  If the action is eligible for execution  the program   executes it  steps the agent s clock forward  and uses the same process to select the next action  If no   action is eligible for execution  the program simply steps all agent clocks forward until one or more   actions is eligible for execution    63    Finally  a stopping criterion defines when the simulation ends  This criterion is met when all safety   factors in the global model exceed 1 0 and the design is within two percent of the optimum mass  This   is one difference from human gameplay where the integrator decides when to stop based on a   subjective judgment of the tradeoff between additional time to improve the design and lost sales  If   the stability criterion is not reached by 500 virtual weeks the simulation ends    6 2  Designing Simulation Agents   The simulation agents mimic the behavior of game players pursuing various strategies  For each   decision and action a game player might take in the game  several potentially reasonable rules a player   might use in making the decision are defined  Given that some actions are only possible or appropriate   under certain conditions  each agent selects its actions based on logical decision rules  The choices each   agent might make are outlined immediately below        Integrator Agent Actions and Decisions   o  Run global stress model and disseminate results      Section Design Agent Actions and Decisions   o  Select which members to adjust and determine their new thicknesses   o  Run local stress model to calculate safety factors based on section thicknesses and current   loads   o  Submit current design to integrator   The following two sections describe the how current program policies and alternative policies are   implemented via agent decision rules for when and how to take the actions listed above    6 3  Modeling Current Program Policies   Two current program policies are most relevant to this investigation  the program s policy  largely set   by the OEM  for deciding when to run its global finite element model and the suppliers  policies    heavily influenced by the OEM  for when designs are suitable for submission to the OEM for inclusion in   the its global finite element model    In the actual program the OEM runs the global model approximately once every twelve weeks  Its   intent is to release updated loads at a regular frequency to provide suppliers sufficient time to update   their designs in response to updated loads  The OEM typically waits for all suppliers to submit updated   designs before running the global stress model  In the event a supplier falls behind schedule in   submitting a design update  the OEM typically works with the supplier to support it in completing the   update as quickly as possible  but will not necessarily delay running the global model  In this   circumstance the OEM typically either uses the most recent design or a partial update from the   64    supplier  To approximately mirror this policy in the agent based simulation  the integrator agent may   run the global model and disseminate updated loads after the earlier of the following two events       All three SDAs have submitted design updates        Twelve virtual weeks pass since the most recent global model iteration    When supplier engineers run their local stress models  they adjust thicknesses for various parts of their   area of component responsibility  As a general rule  they first add material to any areas where safety   factors are below 1 0  They run the local stress model and repeat if necessary until all safety factors are   above 1 0  Next they attempt to reduce the thicknesses of areas with safety factors above 1 0  using the   current safety factor as a guide for how much material can safely be removed  They repeat this process   until all safety factors fall within a range of 1 0 to 1 05 or 1 10  then submit the design to the   integrator    In the simulation  SDAs adjust all truss section members between iterations of the local stress model    The new member thickness is set to              where m is the current member thickness  n is the current   safety factor  and k is a very small positive value if         and a very small negative value if          In   practical terms  this means the agent sets the new thickness to the value that the current safety factor    absent interaction with other members  indicates would give a new safety factor of 1 0  The small   constant k is added to avoid adjustments that asymptotically approach zero but require engineers    time  This constant increases the thickness if the safety factor is below 1 0 and decreases it if the safety   factor is above 1 0  The SDA also cannot set the thickness to values less than the lower bound of 1 0 or   higher than the upper bound of 2000    After updating all eligible section member thicknesses  the SDA runs the local stress model  SDAs   submit updated designs to the integrator after each iteration of the local stress model where all safety   factors fall between 1 0 and 1 075  1 075 was selected because it is the center point of the range from   1 05 to 1 10 of the aircraft program s maximum acceptable safety factor    6 4  Summary   This chapter has explained how the author adapted the simulation game for automated agent based   simulation  It has explained how the simulation environment is structured and the decision rules by   which agents mimic current policies or execute alternative ones  The next chapter presents and   interprets the results of the agent based simulations of current and alternative policies    65    7  Agent Based Simulation Results   This chapter presents the results of several thousand agent based simulation iterations exploring the   potential strategies outlined above and discusses their implications  Graphs show representative results   of several parameters over the course of the game  For brevity and clarity  only parameters associated   with the outboard section of the truss are shown  results for other truss sections are similar  Some   charts show how safety factors or thickness values for individual outboard section truss members   change over the course of the simulation  in chart legends these are identified by the pair of joints the   member connects  Figure 18   Several of these charts also show when certain important events occur to   help readers interpret the data  such as when the global model or local models are run and when SDPs   submit updates to the integrator  Summary charts of several rounds of the simulation are based on 30   iterations with the same set of parameters       Figure 18  Outboard Section of Truss Highlighted and its Members Labeled   Before delving into the results of current and alternative policies  it is helpful to examine exactly what   drives the design oscillation that occurs  Figures 19 through 21 show results of an agent simulation   where SDAs cannot submit designs until they are very highly optimized even more than current   program policy would require the acceptable safety factor range is from 1 0 to 1 01  As a result  the   SDA adjusts each section until it reaches its current optimum design before the global model is   updated  It is called the current optimum as opposed to the true optimum because it is based on the   current loads applied by the combination of external forces and interface loads applied by other   sections  While external loads do not change  interface loads depend of the designs of the   corresponding other sections and may differ from the interface loads applied in the optimum design   for the whole truss    66    At the outset of the simulation  each SDA adjusts its design  temporarily isolated from the effects of   other agents  changes  In Figure 19 the Current Thickness series shows how the outboard SDA changes   the thickness of its section member CE over the course of the simulation  The Current Local Optimum   series shows the optimal thickness given current loads on the truss section and given the current   thickness of other members the same agent controls  this information is available to the agent after   each time it runs the local stress model  The Current Global Optimum series shows what the optimal CE   member thickness would be  given other agents  changes to their own designs  at each point in the   course of the simulation information only available to an omniscient game facilitator with real time   information on SDAs  changes  Between snapshot updates about these changes via updates to loads    the outboard SDA is blind to how other SDAs  changes affect the loads on its component  and   therefore to the apparent optimal thicknesses for each member    The charts below show that each time the global model runs  the SDA discovers that the members   shown are too weak or too heavy and adds or removes material to reach the new target thickness    which is the last known apparent optimum thickness    OS Member CE Thickness Values   Thickness    775   725   675   625   575  Jan 00  Mar 00  Apr 00  Jun 00  Current Global Optimum  Current Local Optimum  Current

Figure 20  Changing Current Optima Drive Design Oscillation  Truss Member DF Values   Truss member CD exhibits interesting patterns of change that illustrates how coupling affects   oscillation in the truss design  The loads on members CE and DF and their thicknesses predominantly   determine the loads on CD  The reader will observe a positive correlation between the thicknesses of CE   and CD and a negative one between the thicknesses of CD and DF  In this case these interactions tend   to ratchet CD s thickness up over the course of the simulation  Figure 21   When a new target thickness   is greater than the current thickness  the agent makes CD thicker  But when the stress model runs  in   the truss s equilibration of the loads  CD tends to draw additional load and stress from neighboring   members  so in order to reach a safety factor of 1 0 it must overshoot its initial target  In the opposite   case where the new target is below the current thickness  CD s thickness decreases but changes to   other members keep CD from decreasing all the way to its apparent optimum while still meeting stress   requirements    68    OS Member CD Thicknesses Values   Thickness

Design Oscillation  Truss Member CD Values   In summary  these figures show how the current optimum thicknesses for each truss member in their   respective sections changes in response to changes to other truss members  Since each SDA only learns   of updates periodically  it adjusts the actual thickness toward the last known apparent optimum   thickness until it receives updated loads

22   First  the reader will observe that safety factors oscillate    Initially they change dramatically whenever an update from running the global model becomes   available  signified by large black dots  In theory these apparently large changes are not sudden  they   are the accumulated result of many changes to other section designs since the last update  The delay in   learning about the effect of those changes is what makes them appear sudden and drastic  Second  the   reader will observe that after the large jumps  safety factors move more gradually toward the current   optimum thicknesses that give safety factors near 1 0  this is the result of action in the section design   player level sizing loop  Third  the pattern of adjustment appropriately matches policy members with   safety factors below 1 0 are adjusted first  sometimes raising other safety factors even higher  and then   members with safety factors above 1 0 are thinned toward safety factors of 1 0  Fourth  the reader will   observe the outboard section design is typically the last one to be submitted before the global model   runs  especially in early iterations  This means it frequently takes longer for the outboard section design   to fall within acceptable safety factors  likely because it has the highest number of truss members and   thus the most interdependencies   Safety Factors under

22  Safety Factors under Current Policy   One of Spirit engineers  primary complaints about the actual development process was that loads on   their components frequently and dramatically shifted throughout the course of development  Figure 23   70    shows how loads on outboard section members varied over the course of the current policy simulation    relative to the loads on the truss under the optimal  equitable configuration  The chart is punctuated   with black dot markers for each point at which the global model was run  As expected  the loads in the   simulation constantly change

Global Model     Figure 23  Percent Difference from Optimal Loads under Current Policy   A closer look at the thickness values associated with each of these members helps clarify why they   change so much during the course of the simulation and why they end up so far from the optimum    Figure 24 shows how outboard section member CD s thickness changed in comparison to the current   local and global optima and the true optimum  The reader will first observe that the actual thickness   roughly  chases  the current local and global optima  which do not necessarily move toward the true   optimum  The reader will also observe that the local and global optima frequently diverge for a period    then  snap back together  when the global model is run  This occurs because SDAs work independently   but global model iterations bring them to a shared knowledge of design changes since the previous   iteration and thus a shared implicit understanding of interface loads on each

 This is an artifact of the order in which agents and engineers in the actual   program address safety factors  The reader will recall that agents first increase the thickness of   members with safety factors below 1 0 and only when all safety factors are above 1 0 do they begin to   reduce thicknesses of overweight members  Thus whenever the current local optimum is above the   current actual thickness the agent promptly increases the thickness to that value  In contrast  it does   not decrease thicknesses toward current local optima until all underweight members have been   addressed    Finally  in consequence of the oscillating thickness values  the overall mass for each section and for the   whole truss oscillates over the course of the simulation  Figure 26 shows how the outboard section   mass oscillates relative to the true optimum mass  Note that this chart shows only how the outboard   section mass compares to its optimum  other sections may end at different points on this scale and   thus the mass optimality of the overall truss may also be different  In all cases  for the stopping   criterion to be reached  the final truss mass must be above the optimum  or minimum feasible  mass    OS Mass Percent Difference from Optimal   6   4   2   0    2   Jan 00  Mar 00  Apr 00  Jun 00  Mass  Optimum Mass  Run Global Model     Figure 26  Percent Difference from Optimal

model  The current policy  used in the examples in Section 7 1  is to run the model when all   three SDAs have submitted design updates  The next simulations show what happens when the   integrator agent runs the global model after one or two suppliers submits design updates    73    Running the global model after only one or two SDAs submit updates reduces the time to reach the   stopping criterion  Figure 27 shows summary results illustrating that both mean and variance decrease   when the global model runs after only one or two agent submissions  Specifically  running the global   model after two agents submit updates reduces mean convergence time by 46 9  and running it after   one agent submits reduces it by 55 7     Global Model Run Policy Variation   Time at   Completion

waits for two supplier updates before running the global   model  convergence occurs earlier and with less oscillation overall  Figure 28   Interestingly  however    the outboard SDA does not submit any design updates until near the end of the process  Again  this is   because the outboard section is the most complex component with the highest number of   interdependencies  so it tends to take longer for the outboard SDA to achieve an acceptable design    Before the outboard SDA can finish doing so it receives updated loads and works toward an acceptable   design with those  In essence the outboard section is forced to accommodate changes to other sections   without influencing them  The effect of interactions is also visible in this chart  the reader will observe   that safety factors for CD  which is heavily influenced by CE and DF  tends to roughly trace a centerline   between the safety factors for these other two members  following somewhat more closely whichever   is farther from 1 0  The team achieves convergence somewhat faster than current policy  and perhaps   surprisingly  even though the outboard section has less  input  in the final design  the mass is more   equitably distributed across the sections    Safety Factors under Two Submission Policy   Safety  Factor   1 15  1 10  1 05  1 00  0 95  0 90  Jan 00  CD  DE  Mar 00  Apr 00  Jun 00  CE  EF  DF  CF

to run the global   model after only two SDAs have submitted updates  First a comparison of the loads on members under   each policy shows less oscillation in general under the latter policy for most members  Figure 29 and   Figure 30   It also shows smaller divergences from the optimal loads distribution  except for CE  CE   bears the heaviest load in the truss  When the agent increases its thickness to bring safety factors   75    toward 1 0 it draws additional load from neighboring members  shifting their optimal thicknesses   downward and its own upward  The neighboring members are adjusted to take advantage of this   change  later preventing CE from being thinner because that would force those members to safety   factors below 1 0  CD also fares rather poorly because it is

additional iterations of the global model  If  in reality  running the   global finite element model at this frequency is exceptionally costly or takes more time than in the   simulation  this strategy will not work  However  if the characterization is correct that running the   global model adds minimal marginal cost and requires but a few hours for a full analysis  this may be   both feasible and advantageous    7 3  Effect of Decreasing the Minimum Safety Factor to Submit   This simulation set evaluates the effect of adjusting the minimum safety factor allowed in a design   submitted to the integrator  retaining the original policy that the integrator must wait for all three   SDAs to submit design updates before running the global model  The first premise to test is whether   changing these variables affects the time required for SDAs  after receiving a loads update  to achieve   an acceptable design  If doing so increases this time overall  the time to reach design convergence is   also likely to increase  Figure 36 shows that the time to submit an updated design is decreases   exponentially with the distance from 1 0    Time to Submit Design Update After

The results show that this change   drastically reduces both the mean and standard deviation of the time to convergence  It also slightly   improves how near the final mass the optimum is and reduces the inequity in the final distribution of   masses to an average of 1 4   more than either of the previously tested policies    82    Table 7  Summary Statistics for Performance with Decreased Min

Factor to Submit   This simulation set evaluates the effect of adjusting the maximum safety factor allowed in a design   submitted to the integrator  As with reducing the minimum safety factor for design submissions we   find that increasing the distance of this variable from 1 0 dramatically reduces the time required for   each SDA to make its design acceptable for submission to the integrator  especially for the most   complex section  Figure 41     The program s current maximum allowable safety factor of 1 05 to 1 10  modeled as 1 075  has an   average time of 4 56 virtual weeks between submissions for all sections  Given the simulation results    this suggests that increasing the maximum allowable safety factor alone is likely to yield only small   improvement  but that decreasing it could prove very detrimental to the time to converge    Time to Submit Design Update After Loads Update   Avg  Time   80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0  Current  Policy   1  1 05  1 1  1 15  1 2  1 25  Max

combined effects of reducing the minimum allowable safety factor  increasing the maximum  and   changing the global model run policy are explored next  A series of surface charts shows that changes   to all three can dramatically reduce the time to converge  These figures are based on 50 iterations of   the agent model for each gridline intersection representing a combination of minimum and maximum   safety factors for submission and a policyy for the number of submissions that triggers a global model   run  Figure 46 shows the three surface charts next to one another for ready visual comparison with the   leftmost representing the policy of waiting for three agents to submit updates before running the   global model and the rightmost representing waiting for only one  These charts are repeated in larger   sizes in the subsequent figures Figure 47 through Figure 49       Figure 46  Comparison of Policy Surface Charts   The reader will observe that reducing the number of submissions to trigger an update reduces the time   to convergence  especially in the region with minimum safety factors near 1 0  The reader will also   observe a trend of consistently decreasing times to completion as the minimum safety factor decreases   from 1 0  Finally  the reader will observe an apparent  sweet spot  valley in all three charts where the   maximum safety factor is 1 075  This means that under the modeled conditions and assumptions  the   agent based model consistently reaches its stopping criterion most quickly when the maximum safety   factor threshold is 1 075  as compared to other values  provided that the minimum safety factor is   below approximately 0 98  Due to limited time and resources the author did not investigate the reasons   for the location of this sweet spot  but theorizes it may be primarily a function of other modeling   assumptions and parameters    90   0 80 911 051 11 151 21 252030405060Min SF to SubmitRun Global Model After THREE Agents

  Where current policies require an average of 30 8 virtual weeks to converge  running the global model   after only one agent submits an update and with a minimum allowable safety factor of 0 95 and   maximum of 1 15  the design converges to the same standard and a similarly equitable result in  on   average  11 0 virtual weeks  64 3  faster than under current policy                   92   0 80

exacerbated when the global model is run after only one or two   submissions  in those cases the outboard SDA receives updated loads before it has finished adjusting to   the previous set and must restart before submitting its update  Under this policy  however  all SDAs are   able to submit with relatively equal frequency  Two factors contribute to this change  First  the loads   changes at each sizing loop are smaller and thus require less change to accommodate them  And   second  the looser safety factor requirements mean that often even with the smaller loads changes the   designs are easier to bring within safety factor bounds  This allows the changes to the design to be   more balanced across all the section designers    93    Safety Factors under Combined Policy   Safety  Factor

agent based simulations exploring the performance   under current policies and under alternative policies  As predicted  current policies yield design   oscillation that delays design convergence  Each of the tested alternative policies yields significant   improvement in convergence time  Running the global stress model after only one or two SDAs submit   updates somewhat shortens the time to completion and slightly reduces the level of inequity in the   97          final design s distribution of mass  Widening the band of acceptable safety factors also reduces   convergence time  with reductions to the minimum safety factor to submit providing much greater   improvement than increasing the maximum safety factor threshold  Increasing the maximum safety   factor threshold also reduces the equitability of the distribution among sections of mass in the final   design and it increases the average final mass while reducing the lower threshold has the opposite   effect on both  The combined policy changes of running the global stress model more frequently and   relaxing both safety factor thresholds improves average performance to roughly the same degree as   reducing the minimum safety factor alone  The combined policy change offers more consistent   improvement but a higher risk of inequity in the distribution of mass    98    8  Human Simulation Game Results   During a training workshop at Spirit s Wichita headquarters  several senior Spirit personnel from a   variety of aircraft programs participated in the simulation game  Participants included a former chief   engineer for Spirit s A350 fuselage section program  senior program managers  a structural design   manager  a lead systems engineer  a knowledge based engineering tools development leader  and   others  Each was randomly assigned to play the role of either the integrator or one of the SDPs for the   game  The team played one session of the game  followed by a debriefing and discussion  then played   another session of the game to try to improve their results  Because the connection between designing   the truss and designing an airplane wing are so close  participants  comments during and after the   game often framed the game situation as if it were airplane design    8 1  Pre Game Expectations   After an introduction to the scenario and gameplay format  participants completed a Pre Game survey   with several questions oriented toward their expectations and intended strategies  Appendix B  Pre   Game Survey   This clarifies mental models of the sizing loop process with which participants   approached the game  especially the degree to which intended strategies match current program   policies    8 1 1  Time to Completion   The pre game survey asked participants to predict the time  in virtual weeks  required to reach an   acceptable design and to reach a final design  participants were informed only of the time to perform   each task in the game to guide their estimation  Figure 56 shows responses  In general  players   expected to achieve a design that met stress requirements rather quickly and to achieve final results a   design that both met stress requirements and fell below the target mass at either the same time they   achieved final results or in about three times more time  Most respondents anticipated first achieving   an acceptable design at four to eight virtual weeks  2 67 to 5 33 minutes of gameplay time  though   one respondent estimated the time to an acceptable design at 40 virtual weeks and the time to a final   design at 100 virtual weeks    99    Predicted Times to Acceptable and Final Designs   Probable erroneous   entry   1  2  4  8  16  32  64  128  Virtual Weeks  Log Base 2 Display    Time to Acceptable Design  Time to Final Design     Figure 56  Predicted Times to Acceptable and Final Designs   The survey also posed questions regarding players  expectations regarding the number of team and   individual iteration cycles to reach a final design  One question asked  on average  how many times a   player would need to adjust member thicknesses and calculate safety factors before submitting a   design update to the integrator  This process represents the player sizing loop of receiving new inputs    loads data  and updating one s design accordingly  Another question asked  on average  how many   times the integrator would need to disseminate updated design inputs to the SDPs before the team   reached a final design  This question essentially asks players to estimate the number of team sizing   loops required to reach a final design  Multiplying participants  responses to both questions gives their   effective estimates of the total number of local sizing loops they will need to perform  Responses are   shown in Figure 57    100    Predicted Individual and Team Sizing Loop Iterations   Predicted Individual   Sizing Loop   Iterations per Team  Sizing Loop Iteration   25  20  15  10  5  0  0  5

three iterations  the first for  rough sizing   the second for    refinement   and the third for  optimization   He also planned to  work schedule to have time for   another iteration if needed     One might have expected estimates of the total iterations to completion to be similar  but divided   between those who expected many individual sizing loops and few team sizing loops  or many team   sizing loops and relatively few individual sizing loops  But interestingly  the positive correlation  0 44    between estimates of each of these two values suggest that participants were either optimistic or   pessimistic about the time to completion  expecting both to be either high or low    8 1 2  Adjusting Thicknesses   In response to a question about their approach to adjusting thicknesses  most participants described a   plan to adjust member thicknesses in a controlled fashion based on safety factor feedback  One  for   example  stated he would  adjust members by 10  factor  meaning he did not intend to change   thicknesses more than 10  between each local model iteration  Another planned to change using    marginal increments without wide swings to try and help convergence if the other parties do the   same   Others specifically mentioned safety factors as a guide to determining how much to change   thicknesses    8 1 3  Safety Factors and Submitting Design Updates   The survey asked participants to specify what they thought were the lowest and highest acceptable   safety factors for a SDP s design to be submitted to the integrator  Most respondents set the minimum   101    safety factor at 1 0  Some participants planned to use a very narrow band of acceptable safety factors   asymptotically approaching 1 0  while others were more lenient than the aircraft program s policy    Figure 58     Acceptable Safety Factor Ranges   Average Response   Agent Model   Program Policy   0 7  0 8  0 9  1  1 1  1 2  1 3  1 4  1 5     Figure 58  Acceptable Safety Factor Ranges in Pre Game Survey Responses   While participants  decision rules for submitting design updates to the integrator run the gamut of   possibilities  most suggest intent to at least

to characterize the general attitude  he planned to submit   updates  initially when all  safety factors  are above 1 0  unless this takes too long to meet schedule    then adjust to submit more frequently to give integrator visibility and get feedback that may be   helpful     8 1 4  Running the Global Model   Participants offered the clearest consensus with respect to their decision rules for running the global   model  Every response indicated the expectation of running the global model only after all SDPs had   submitted designs  matching current program policy  The primary variation in responses is that some   indicated an intent to schedule global model runs  setting target times for players to submit updates    while others did not specify any scheduling plans    102    8 1 5  Meeting Stress Requirements and Reducing Mass   One survey question asked participants how they would respond if the truss was not strong enough   when the target completion deadline approached  and another asked how they would respond if the   deadline neared and the truss were too heavy  Answers to both questions reveal how participants think   about dealing with the tension between these two goals  Other than the obvious answers  beef up    or  slim down  participants  suggestions always required either approval from the integrator or   coordination with the integrator and other players  Some players  for example  suggested asking the   integrator to relax some requirements or renegotiating mass targets  Two others proposed submitting   updates faster and more frequently while a third suggested calling a team meeting to coordinate   everyone s effort  One player observed that the deadline might have to slip and the SDPs would have to    ask for more funding     8 2  Observed Behavior Patterns in First Round Gameplay   Several behavior patterns emerged in players  first experience with the simulation game  In general   behavior patterns were driven by players taking a role centric perspective rather than a systems   perspective  First  integrators spent a significant portion of the game time consulting with SDPs to help   them adjust their designs to meet stress requirements or reduce mass  Second  SDPs tended to refine   their designs until the integrator called for update submissions  even beyond when all their safety   factors were within the acceptable band for submission  The fundamental flaw in both behaviors is to   treat the current loads as if it were the final or optimum distribution of loads    After each release of updated loads data from the global model  most section design players worked   aggressively toward the narrow ranges of safety factors they had specified in pre game surveys before   submitting design updates  In post game discussion one participant explained how this approach   mirrored real behavior influenced by contractual constraints in several programs on which Spirit works     In some cases  contractually we can t release  designs  unless the margin of safety is within a   certain threshold around 1 0  We can t release anything unless it s  less than  1 05  So there s   going to be some iteration  And in other cases  if you look at how we used to design airplanes     we intentionally kept some excess material in the design in the early phases so that it was   easier to adjust later   We can t do that now with the OEMs really putting a lot of review on   some of the  mass  margins that we re carrying because they automatically relate to weight     SDPs  effort to improve their designs also generally discounted the potential for future changes to   section loads  Despite their knowledge that loads were likely to change  SDPs engineered their designs   as if the loads were stable and final  Even after they had met stress requirements within the mass   target they continued to tinker with the design  trying to optimize their section s mass further    103    Sometimes they submitted when requirements were first met and then submitted improved designs    other times they simply worked until the integrator explicitly called for design updates  In essence they   worked as though their job was to meet customer requirements as delivered  and to chase after the   changes as they came  In post game discussion  one participant described how this mimics reality     As soon as  suppliers  get a new load set the designers are off getting stress analysis for   changing the thickness on the parts and doing some design work  So then they get another    analysis  run  from the OEM  and the loads have changed  so now the design and the   thicknesses have to change  People say that  the suppliers are  just sitting around doing   nothing but that s not true  The problem is that they re taking action based on data or   assumptions that aren t right yet     His observation is exactly consistent with the point made by Browning et al  that  in many cases  lack   of value stems less from doing unnecessary activities and more from doing necessary activities with the   wrong information  and then having to redo them    2002   The author notes that the problem is not   so much that the data or assumptions are not yet right  but that designers spend too much time   working with them  given their immaturity    Sometimes the loads on a section were high enough that it was impossible for SDPs to create a design   that both met stress requirements and was lighter than the target mass  SDPs never knew for certain   whether this was the case  they only knew when it was especially difficult  When it was  they often   spent significant time trying to find a way to meet stress requirements within the mass target    Eventually they sometimes called the integrator to essentially request he somehow either lighten their   loads or increase the mass target  In reality  the OEM often received similar requests to adjust mass   targets when suppliers found it otherwise difficult to meet requirements  This also often occurred only   after significant engineering effort that had convinced suppliers the current requirements and targets   were infeasible    Of course none of the players could know what that true optimum was in advance  Even if a SDP had   known the true optimal design in advance  it would not have been acceptable unless all the others   players had also built their true optimal designs early as well  At the end of one team s game  for   example  a SDP complained that in the final design  his section design was very similar to his early   designs   This pretty much ended up where I was a long time ago   He was annoyed at having done so   much work since then  only to come back to the same design later  The reason his early near optimal   designs were abandoned was that at that time the loads on his section were different than they were   in the final design  This is why no single SDP can bring the team to the optimal design on its own    104    A counterproductive behavior pattern that integrators demonstrated was a reluctance to run their   global stress models before all SDPs had submitted design updates  In several cases  integrators had   received two updates from SDPs  and then waited for the remaining supplier s update to run the global   stress analysis model  During such situations they frequently joined the delinquent supplier at his   computer screen to help adjust the section design until it was ready for submission  This approach of   batching analysis of design updates suggests a belief that global stress analysis iterations are a   necessary evil to be minimized  The negative effect of this approach is that it introduces unnecessary   delays in feeding update information to suppliers about the evolution of critical inputs to their designs    It may seem odd to criticize integrators  behavior of waiting for the final SDP to submit updates in light   of the previous arguments against working with incorrect or incomplete information  The key point   here is that spending significant effort to optimize design outputs against immature design inputs does   not add value to the program  The effort spent on adjusting designs to accommodate changed inputs   should correlate with the maturity of that information  The best gauge of input data maturity is the   amplitude of oscillations in the design inputs  When inputs are oscillating it is best to minimize the   period of oscillation to decrease the amount that designs can change in each iteration  Put briefly    when input data is immature it is best to force fast  low amplitude oscillation even with immature   information as long as it helps bring the separate designs toward convergence  Later  when inputs are   mature and oscillations are low even if iterations are long  it is worth spending additional effort to   optimize them  Integrators in the game erred by allowing SDPs to spend more time on their designs   than was warranted  given fluctuations in loads  early in the design process    8 3  First Round Results   This section presents the quantitative results of this game and explanation of trends in the same for   one of those teams  results for the other team were generally similar  A programming error prevented   the recording of player actions during this game  but some recorded parameters allow the author to   infer when the global model was run  Other data logging was unaffected by this error    Game participants were disappointed with the results of the first round of the game  after 55 minutes    82 virtual weeks  one team had never achieved an acceptable design and the other finished with only   a small number of orders whose deadlines had not expired  As in reality  team participants found   themselves struggling against oscillating loads which delayed final design definition well beyond the   initial target of 40 virtual weeks  Figure 59 shows the realtime loads on

conducted a facilitated post mortem examination of their   disappointing results and how they might be improved  We first reviewed the charts shown in the   previous section that describe how all the key parameters evolved over the course of the game  Next   we discussed plausible sources of the oscillation  especially given the revelation that external loads had   never changed    After this discussion the team discussed and selected alternative strategies for the next round of the   game    8 4  Indicated Gaps between Mental Models and Reality   Game participants  behavior patterns indicate certain mental models by which they reasoned about the   structure they were designing and the process by which they designed it  In short  all members of the   team acted as though the truss sections were significantly more independent than they actually were    After the first round  one participant explained  we didn t understand what affected what in the game    truss    This seems to have expressed itself in players discounting the effect of other components    designs on the loads experienced by their component  As a result  each player treated the current load   set as if it were the final load set or close to it  Similarly  participants did not seem to recognize the   effect of their design changes on other sections    There are at least two possible reasons for this mindset  both of which may have contributed to game   participants  approach  The first is that participants may assume that when future and final loads are   unknown  it is best to treat the current loads as a reasonable approximation of them  The second is   that because participants spent little time studying how their sections interacted  they were unaware of   the interactions or discounted their impacts    When game participants treated current loads as if they were final loads  they effectively treated the   current optimum design as the true optimum  The fundamental source of oscillation in this product   development system is the discounting of loads uncertainty that leads participants to spend longer   optimizing a design than is desirable given the uncertainty in the parameters on which it is based    Feedback  in the form of changing loads  from other participants was so delayed that the design   change process likely appeared to be an open loop  Each SDP was very aware that others  changes   affected his loads  but much less aware of his impacts on theirs  Figure 67   This should not be   surprising  there were no direct incentives to manage impacts to other sections  and there was   sufficient time pressure that participants began making adjustments without studying section   interactions    110    Others change  section designs   My changes   affect loads on  other sections   Others  changes  affect loads on   my section   I change my  section design      Figure 67  Section Design Players Underestimate the Effect of Their Changes on Other Sections   8 5  Indicated Gaps between Incentives and Desired Behaviors   The structure of incentives throughout the game and throughout the real extended enterprise   significantly affects the behavior of the actors therein  When the incentive structure is not consistent   with the enterprise s ultimate goals  counterproductive behaviors are sure to emerge  After the first   round one participant observed that  one of the situations we have in some of these  aircraft    programs is that various parts have penalties associated with weight  So what you end up with is each   partner trying optimize its own area and sub optimizing everything else in the meantime   The focus of   incentives on local performance  rather than system performance  in both the game and the extended   enterprise  make it easy for both sets of teams to get  stuck  at local optima that may be quite far   from the system s global optimum  For the same reasons  they reinforce a mindset that each   component is relatively independent of the others    In particular  because each supplier and section designer faces significant penalties for exceeding mass   targets for its own part or section  and incentive payments for designing below the mass target  they   will resist any changes which require them to add mass to their designs  In general this is a desirable   behavior  but it becomes problematic in tightly coupled systems with nonlinear interdependencies  In   such systems  there may well be many situations where increasing the mass for one part would allow   design changes in other parts that provide a net decrease in mass for the system  More broadly  in   coupled systems the apparently suboptimal design of one component might allow for more optimal   111    system design  In these cases  incentives oriented around local performance will generate resistance to   system improvements that come at the expense of components    While these locally oriented incentives reduce the complexity of each team s work  they add transaction   costs by inserting a wedge in interface negotiations  Instead of seeking the optimal interface for the   whole system  each supplier organization will attempt to minimize its contribution to load sharing at   and persuade or force the team designing the interfacing part to bear as much of the shared loads as   possible  While game participants were not able to negotiate directly with one another  some indirect   negotiation like behavior occurred  For example  several participants avoided increasing the thickness   of truss members in their sections  somewhat akin to refusing to add material in a component  in   hopes that they could either find another way to reduce the stress in that member or that their   counterpart would make changes to reduce it    8 6  Observed Behavior Patterns in Gameplay under Revised Strategies   In the second round of the game  teams tried damping responses to change and quickly cycling local   and global models to keep every team member s data as  fresh  as possible  Integrators would run   their global models and disseminate results as soon as they received any update from any SDPs  SDPs   would damp their responses to changed inputs and submit updated designs when they had achieved   only a  70  solution  adjustment to updated loads  This required SDPs and integrators to both   significantly widen the band of safety factors acceptable for submission    In addition to these planned changes  team members spent much more time than before sharing   information with one another  Instead of going to assist section designers with their designs    integrators frequently gathered teammates around their own screens to share what they were   observing about the overall design evolution  The analogous change to the actual program would be   for the integrator to share information about the wider system with suppliers rather than just the data   relevant to each supplier s components  The author cannot definitively distinguish between the effects   of this more frequent and broader information sharing and the effects of the policy changes in the   team s final results  However the agent based simulation implementing comparable policy changes and   without communication changes produced results similar to second round gameplay  suggesting the   policy change was probably a strong contributor to team s improved results    8 7  Second Round Gameplay Results   Teams were dramatically more successful during the second round of the game  Where one team had   failed to even achieve an acceptable design in the 82 virtual weeks of the first round  this time they   achieved an acceptable design in 22 virtual weeks  then optimized it until they ended the game at 34   virtual weeks  The mass of the least optimal final section design was only 4 49  greater than the true   112    optimum and the overall mass was within 1 28  of the true optimum  While oscillation still occurred    the periods of oscillations were much shorter and the amplitude much smaller    This new approach kept the interface loads on sections much more stable  Figure 68 and Figure 69    note the first round vertical scale is an order of magnitude larger than the second round scale     Loads on OS Members Percent Differences from Optimal during First Round   150   100

team of senior engineers and program   managers at Spirit  During the first round of the game  participants pursued intuitive strategies  which   generally match the current policies for the aircraft program studied  These strategies yielded design   oscillations that delayed convergence to the degree that one team did not achieve an acceptable design   in the allotted game time  After a debriefing and discussion  the teams played a second round using   the combined strategy tested in agent based simulation  This time the teams  results were dramatically   better in all measures  The team achieved convergence in less than one third of the allotted time and   the final mass was very near the true optimum and equitably distributed among the truss sections    116    9  Conclusions and Recommendations   This thesis examines complex product development in extended enterprises from three perspectives    First  it offers a theoretical perspective identifying product development system behaviors to expect   when the product architecture is misaligned with the enterprise architecture  These behaviors include   increased change cascades  slowed iteration  increased loop gain  and system delays  which together   generate design oscillations that delay design convergence  Anecdotal evidence presented throughout   the thesis illustrates that these behaviors occurred in the actual program  Second  it presents an agent   based simulation model of a problem mimicking the structural features of the aircraft program studied    Simulations show that current aircraft program policies will tend to generate the oscillation and delay   symptoms described by the theoretical discussion  and that alternative policies to reduce loop gain and   delays dramatically reduces those symptoms  Finally  it describes the results of a game with expert   human participants working on the same fundamental problem  Game participants  intuitive strategies   and inferred behavior roughly mimic important aspects of current aircraft program policy and generate   design oscillations that delay convergence  but when participants applied the alternative strategies that   improved agent based simulation results  game participants  results similarly improved in a dramatic   fashion    9 1  General Recommendations   The author here presents several general recommendations based on issues raised in study of the   program in question  The subsequent section offers recommendations more specifically derived from   the game and simulation described  This chapter concludes with opportunities to extend this research   through further study    9 1 1  Match Product and Enterprise Architectures   This thesis evaluates the hypothesis that mismatched product and enterprise architectures can   experience undesired system behaviors  Specifically  decentralized enterprises designing integrated   products will tend to experience design oscillations that delay final design definition  A theoretical   evaluation supports this conclusion and both agent based and human simulation results demonstrate   how these occur in problems patterned after the program at hand  Further  simulation results show   that when the enterprise adjusts management policies to allow it to work like a more integrated   enterprise  the oscillations and delays are dramatically reduced    Of course  as already observed  an ideal match between architectures appears infeasible for the   program in question  development costs and other factors have forced the OEM to decentralize its   effort  The remaining recommendations offer suggestions for firms like the OEM and its suppliers that   are compelled to work with misaligned architectures    117    9 1 2  New Roles and Emphases for Program Leaders   It appears that complex products will increasingly be developed by extended enterprises  This thesis   illustrates that intuitive approaches that achieved success in past development efforts with greater   vertical integration or lower optimization targets can create undesirable outcomes in this ecosystem  In   this program it appears that managers  and engineers  mental models of their work were more strongly   influenced by the enterprise architecture than by the product architecture  For example  OEM personnel   appear to have focused heavily on ensuring individual components met cost  schedule  and technical   expectations while the integrated product architecture would suggest a greater emphasis on design   conflict resolution was more appropriate    One of the most important roles program leaders have in this ecosystem is to foster unified program   identity and inter firm trust  Weak communication is one of the strongest contributors to design   oscillation  Given that program leaders may not be able to co locate component development teams   nor bring them all under the OEM s organizational umbrella  one of the best things they can do to   improve the flow of relevant information is to reduce the invisible barriers between teams  While other   factors can enable improved communication  only inter firm trust will motivate teams to take full   advantage of those opportunities for better collaboration  Building such trust between companies and   teams is no easy feat  it requires both strong leadership and many enabling structures  A few specific   enabling structures are included in subsequent recommendations    Program leaders can facilitate improved iteration by taking and approach that focuses on design   convergence rather than design control  In the past  program leaders controlled  sequential design   through gated review processes where products were expected to meet increasingly stringent   requirements at the close of each phase  Anecdotal evidence presented in this thesis indicates that for   the program in question these expectations have been relatively stringent throughout the development   process  But in this ecosystem  looser requirements are actually more beneficial because they facilitate   faster iteration while allowing engineers to take better advantage of degrees of freedom to optimize   the design    Program leaders can facilitate faster convergence by encouraging teams to deeply study the wider   system and the interdependencies between their components and neighboring ones  They can also   encourage teams to lower loop gain by making smaller changes with each design  From a policy   perspective they can do so by relaxing the requirements for submission of design updates to the   integrator    Program leaders must also structure incentives wisely to motivate behavior consistent with program   objectives and the strategies most likely to achieve them  For the program in question  it appears that   118    under the current structure component level incentives overwhelm system level incentives in guiding   supplier behavior  While both types of incentives are appropriate  a modified structure that allows   suppliers to more concretely capture the benefits of system improvements may be helpful and will be   discussed in greater detail later    9 1 3  Train Integrators to Integrate   Interviews about the aircraft program in question  together with game participants  behavior  suggest   that individuals and teams performing integration functions may misunderstand how best to add value   to the product development effort  Integrators are often selected based on their expertise relative to   the components they are expected to integrate  and may naturally tend to take on a subject matter   expert role  which can be a counterproductive approach    This program was this OEM s first major experience in transitioning aircraft design from an in house   activity to an extended enterprise activity  Even within the OEM this appears to have been a somewhat   abrupt transition  OEM employees tasked to lead integration efforts often had very little training in   their new roles  For many it was probably natural to think of the integration role as leading the   engineering effort of a very distributed team  Under such an approach  the integrator directs trade   studies and guides key engineering decisions for the team  Unfortunately  this is not an integrator s real   role  In fact  with organizational boundaries and hurdles like contract incentives  everyone involved   would likely find it frustrating to work under an  integrator as chief engineer  approach  especially the   integrators    While individuals performing integration functions may simultaneously function as the OEM s decision   making agent  they should recognize these roles are not the same  The decision maker s role is   fundamentally to manage and balance tradeoffs  an integrator s role not  Ideally the integrator s role is   not to act as an approval authority focused on design control  but instead to facilitate information flow   to help interfacing teams work across their interfaces  He or she does this by helping ensure the   relevant design information updates get to the right individuals quickly  keeping everyone s   information fresh  He or she understands the relevant interdependencies well enough to help supplier   teams understand how their work affects that of other teams  and structures those interactions in ways   that protect the various parties  intellectual property    9 1 4  Develop Methods to Share Benefits of System Improvements   OEMs in extended enterprises face a difficult challenge in structuring organizational incentives to   properly align the efforts of all partners with its own objectives  The OEM is ultimately most concerned   with its own performance  In the context of an aircraft program  it is most concerned with the value it   119    creates and captures through the program  OEMs should seek to carefully structure incentives for   suppliers to promote the program s performance    While it seems reasonable to establish mass targets for major components in order to ensure the final   aircraft meets mass targets  there is no guarantee these targets are ideally distributed  Current mass   target allocations are primarily based on the mass proportions of metal aircraft  There are no   guarantees  however  that the principles that led to current mass distributions will apply to composite   materials    Suppliers  decisions are heavily influenced by contract incentives and these raise the transaction costs   of negotiating how loads should be borne in a nearly zero sum game  At present  suppliers have little   incentive to support design changes that add mass to their component s   even if doing so would   reduce overall system mass  Under the current incentive system  suppliers are penalized if their parts   exceeding weight targets and receive incentive payments if the part is under its weight target    Participants in the simulation game illustrated that when it is difficult to meet both stress requirements   and mass targets  engineers often spend significant time trying to find a way to meet them to avoid   penalties    One relatively simple solution the OEM could pursue is to allow suppliers to exchange mass within their   mass targets  This might occur  for example  if one supplier identified a change which would increase   its own component s mass by 100 kg but would allow a 120 kg reduction to another component  At   present  the OEM s only mechanism to persuade the first supplier to increase its component s mass is   to add mass to that supplier s target  with the effect of increasing the overall aircraft mass target  It is   unlikely the OEM could at the same time persuade the other supplier to decrease its mass targets by   the same amount to counteract the change  If  instead  suppliers were allowed to trade mass in their   mass targets with one another  subject verification of engineering feasibility  the OEM could maintain   the same overall aircraft target and the suppliers could negotiate instead how to split the benefit of the   net 20 kg mass savings    9 1 5  Structure Collaboration to Protect Intellectual Property   One of the primary obstacles to collaborative aerospace product development is the desire of each   party to protect its intellectual property  Such property might take the form of technological   capabilities  business processes  or the experiential knowledge of the company s team  Each company is   aware of the possibility that other companies could seek to expand into market adjacencies and that it   could develop capabilities to do so by knowing  too much  about how suppliers in those adjacencies   currently operate  Thus suppliers and the OEM have a strong incentive to protect the details of their   processes  design details  manufacturing processes  etc    120    On the other hand  some knowledge of interfacing components helps each team understand how its   decisions affect the work of those parts  teams  Simply put  it greatly helps a team to know what its   interfacing partners are doing and to understand why  In structuring interactions  integrators should   seek a careful balance in structuring the flow of information between interfacing teams  One approach   might be to create virtual forums where members of each team can openly  regularly discuss options   and decisions each might make at the interfaces rather than in general  Such an approach would   allow each supplier to more effectively optimize its part in concert rather than in conflict with the work   of interfacing teams  while still protecting most of the information about its component that might be   considered proprietary  While it is still possible that suppliers might attempt to manipulate the relevant   processes to reduce the mass of their own components at the expense of others  wisely structured   incentives would help mute such motivations  Then an improved process structure could facilitate more   effective positive collaboration between suppliers    9 1 6   Invest in Information Infrastructure   One of the key points of this thesis is that in extended enterprises  the structure of information flows is   a critical determinant of the group s performance  The information infrastructure that supports the   enterprise s data transactions is thus a critical resource that deserves significant investment  The   integrator for extended enterprises should invest in the resources and capabilities to support a strong   information infrastructure  These investments should ensure                        Information security    Sufficient bandwidth for fast information transfer    Software reliability    Software interoperability  and   Supercomputing capacity where appropriate    A strong information infrastructure is a critical enabler for decentralized enterprises to act like more   integrated ones  provided there is sufficient inter firm trust that teams take full advantage of it    9 2  Simulation Game Based Recommendations   The preceding recommendations are derived from either the general issues observed through   researching the program in question or from observations tangential to the simulation game  such as   the influence of local incentives in delaying design submissions  The following recommendations are   derived more directly from the simulation game discussed in chapters five through eight    121    9 2 1  Shorten the Longest Feedback Loops   The period of the longest central product development feedback loop controls the pace of design   convergence the longer the period the slower the convergence  In this program it is the longest   feedback loop is the enterprise sizing loop  Any steps the program can take to increase the frequency   of sizing loop iterations without overwhelming suppliers are likely to improve convergence  Specific   steps to do so are outlined in the following sections    First  however  there are some apparently reasonable changes the program should not make  It should   work to help its slowest suppliers first rather than accelerate the fastest ones  The length of the sizing   loop depends on the policy for running the global model  but the time to completion is influenced by   the time required for the slowest supplier to respond to load updates  The integrator should therefore   work to assist the slowest supplier or suppliers in submitting updates that allow the next sizing loop   iteration  As described earlier  the integrator need not necessarily wait for the slowest suppliers to   submit design updates  but speeding up the slowest suppliers helps ensure greater balance in the   changes suppliers make to the overall design    Helping speed the slowest suppliers might include providing additional expertise  providing   supercomputing access  or even relaxing that supplier s requirements for submitting design updates    What the integrator should not do is make policy changes that make design changes dramatically   faster for other suppliers that are already faster than others  Doing so effectively gives fast suppliers   more time to optimize their design between sizing loop iterations  effectively increasing their loop gain    9 2 2  Update System Wide Models Frequently   Theory and simulation results indicate there is great value in running the global stress model frequently   because it keeps the assumptions on which supplier engineers base their decisions  fresh  and up to   date  Program policies should facilitate this to the degree possible  Simulation results show that   lowering the proportion of design update submissions required for a global model run achieves this   result and reduces overall design convergence time  but can overwhelm suppliers for the most complex   components  which are then forced to absorb the effects of other changes  While this still tends to   result in a more optimal design overall  the process would likely be frustrating for suppliers that are   consistently receive updated inputs before they have finished responding to the previous set    9 2 3  Encourage Imperfect Intermediate Designs   Simulation results suggest the most effective strategy is to relax the requirements for design updates to   be submitted for use in the global model  While this implies relaxing intermediate design requirements    it does not mean relaxing the requirements for the final design  In the aircraft program engineers seem   122    reluctant  even in early design stages  to submit a component design that does not meet the same   standards the final design will be expected to meet  This is probably due to a combination of factors    Aerospace engineers tend to be especially careful because they are acutely aware of the catastrophic   impacts of failures in their products  Engineering signatories that approve designs appropriately take   very seriously their responsibility to ensure that engineering drawings are accurate and safe  Spirit   engineers also their concerns that regulatory agencies would not approve of practices where at   intermediate design reviews the design did not conform to principles for flightworthiness  The OEM has   also clearly indicated its expectation that designs be highly optimized  In addition  as the design   progresses  they may hope the current iteration is the last and thus design as if it were their last   opportunity to optimize the design    When engineers spend significant effort  especially in early design phases  to achieve an optimal or   even  acceptable  design  much of their effort goes to waste  In fact  in the parlance of lean   manufacturing  they are over processing the data  They know or should know that the input data   on which they depend are subject to change and should be treated as relatively fuzzy values  When the   inputs are fuzzy it does not make sense to work extra hard to create sharply detailed outputs because   they cannot be any more accurate than their fuzzy inputs    Program leaders should encourage quick changes that bring designs closer to the current optima but   do not necessarily meet all requirements yet  While this approach requires more frequent iteration  it   lowers loop gain and therefore ultimately reduces oscillation and the necessity of rework  As the design   progresses toward convergence these expectations can be narrowed toward the ultimate goal of   meeting stress requirements with minimum excess mass  If the simulation game results are an accurate   indicator  this strategy might even reduce the number of sizing loop iterations required to achieve final   design definition    Simulation results showed that lowering the minimum safety factor for design update submission   reduced convergence time  average mass  and inequity in the final distribution of mass  In contrast    while raising the maximum safety factor also reduced convergence time  it increased both average   mass and inequity in its distribution  Persuading program leaders and regulators to actually allow   intermediate designs with safety factors below 1 0  even provided the final design meets   flightworthiness criteria  is sure to be a difficult proposition  Such a change would require a policy   change  cultural change  and possibly regulatory changes  If nothing else leaders and regulators might   worry about eroding the safety focused culture of aerospace engineers  Engineers may also find it   difficult to develop temporarily underperforming components even when they improve the wider   system  This research cannot suggest exactly how actual policies should be changed or implemented    but it does provide strong evidence motivating further research into the merits of such a change    123    9 2 4  Shrink the Fixed Costs of Iterations   Each iteration cycle consumes time and effort  These costs can be split into fixed and variable costs    where fixed costs pertain to activities that must occur each time the iteration cycle repeats and variable   costs correlate strongly with the scope of the activities that must be performed    At present the program s behavior indicates a collective desire to minimize the number of iterations    probably because teams associate it with non value added rework  But simulation results show that   trying to minimize the number of iterations increases loop gain  delaying new iterations and ultimately   driving oscillation that necessitates additional iteration  In fact the human simulation results illustrated   that pursuing a strategy aimed at minimizing iterations actually increased them    This suggests that extended enterprises would likely see greater success by pursuing a strategy with   more iterations  but to reduce the scope of each  If the fixed cost of each iteration cycle remains high    this approach would be infeasible  OEMs and suppliers should thus work to reduce the fixed costs of   each iteration  For the program in question  this means       Reducing the overhead burden of initiating new iterations and completing them  such as   meetings and paperwork  and automating  bookkeeping  tasks as much as possible       Unifying data formats or developing fast  reliable tools to convert data between software   packages as necessary for analysis  This reduces time spent on pre  and post processing data       Restructuring analysis software code to provide preliminary analysis results and allow engineers   to adjust the scope of analyses    The final bullet point above bears brief explanation  Some engineering analysis must be performed    usually by running software for applications such as finite element modeling  to at least verify that the   results of design changes are acceptable  To minimize fixed cost  algorithms and the user interface   should be structured to provide useful feedback as quickly as possible    At present  for example  if the design must be analyzed to verify it passes several tests  designers   cannot know until the end of the analysis that all tests have been passed  But the failure of a design   against any tests is useful information  Code should thus be structured to provide this negative   feedback to users as quickly as possible  rather than waiting for the analysis to finish before reporting   results  Sometimes the right feedback would allow engineers to start mentally formulating the required   changes or would at least tell them to stop further analysis that would waste time    These changes are ultimately aimed at making higher numbers of lower gain iterations palatable to the   OEM and its suppliers  This makes it easier for them to address small  frequent changes to inputs with   less temptation to wait until everything settles down  potentially delaying sizing loop iteration    124    9 3  Future Work   The results of this thesis research suggest several possible areas for related future research  The first   and most obvious is to run additional sessions of the human simulation game to develop a deeper data   set and possibly explore the effects of other alternative team strategies for the problem  Another set of   opportunities focuses on augmenting the game framework to study new dimensions of the game s   problem  Such modifications might include       Making the structure teams design simpler or more complex than the truss used in the game      Changing the number of players in the game      Modifying the incentive structures or mass target structures  perhaps allowing players to   negotiate these as the game progressed      Changing the information infrastructure  for example  allowing real time information between   section design players      Adjusting the times required for various tasks such as running the global model or submitting   an update to the integrator   Another set of research opportunities focuses on extending the capabilities of the agent based model   with more sophisticated agents  Changes to the agents might include       More sophisticated approaches to adjusting the minimum and maximum safety factor   thresholds over the course of the design effort  somewhat like simulated annealing      More sophisticated modeling of agents  decisions when meeting stress factors with current   loads and mass targets appears infeasible           The ability to evaluate whether to spend additional time attempting to reduce mass   The ability to renegotiate mass targets  either with the integrator or through exchanging mass   allocations with other section design players   Finally  at a more general level  this research proposes that managers can control theory principles    especially those related to feedback loop gain  to complex systems such as product development   enterprises to improve their performance  Further investigation of this proposition will likely yield many   insights that will help managers in the complex social and technical systems of product development in   extended enterprises more consistently achieve success in their endeavors    125    Appendix A  Game Scenario Introduction   Introduction to the Wing Design Game   Orville and Wilbur Wright have asked your multi company partnership to design the wings for their   new  extremely fuel efficient Wright Flyer III  which they plan to commercialize    The wing is divided into three sections  an inner structure section  an outer structure section  and a   covers section  There are three roles on the team  one member designs the inner wing  another the   outer wing  and one player serves as the integrator  The integrator player is essentially the  prime    contractor  with the inner and outer section designers serving as subcontractors    The wing is modeled as a very simple truss with inner and outer sections joined at points  c  and  d         In flight the wing experiences various structural loads  In this game  we have a single summary set of   loads applied at various joints of the wing  shown as orange arrows above   Each member  or  rod    between two labeled points  of the wing truss must be thick enough  and therefore strong enough  to   withstand the forces on the wing without breaking  The sections players  design task is to define the   thickness of each member of his or her wing section  When you click   the  Calculate safety factors   your local model of the wing will run and   calculate the ratio of allowable stress to actual stress in each member    For example  a safety factor of 1 15 means that the allowable stress in a   member is 1 15 times larger than the actual stress  while a safety factor   below 1 0 means you need to add thickness for the member to be   strong enough  For the final design to be certifiable for flight  all safety   factors must be above 1 0  For weight  you want them to be as close to   1 0 as possible       126    Our customers have specified that no member of the truss can have a stress  or force per cross   sectional area  exceeding 0 1 stress units  However  any excess thickness in the wing makes it heavier   and reduces the plane s long term fuel efficiency  making it much less desirable to airlines  Your goal is   to make as much money as possible by making the wing as light as possible while ensuring sufficient   strength to keep the stress within limits    The integrator player maintains a global model of the wing design and receives occasional updates to   external loads on the wing  From time to time  when their designs are ready  the section players submit   their designs to the integrator by clicking the  Submit Design  button  The integrator runs the global   model to update the loads on each section from the other  as well as from external forces  and makes   the results available to the section players  Section players can retrieve these updates by clicking the    Get Global Model Loads  button and can use these loads in a local model to check their designs   before submitting them    Pre sales of the plane have been strong  but each order is contingent on the aircraft design meeting   certain weight requirements and being completed by a customer specified deadline  The most   demanding companies  lightest aircraft  earliest deliveries  are willing to pay premiums if your aircraft   meets their stringent requirements  Each section player is paid a fixed fee for each plane sold  as well as   an incentive if their part is under its target mass  If their part is over the target mass  they are assessed   a penalty per part    Your team has developed a good preliminary design but the Wright brothers  latest wind tunnel tests   indicate the loads applied to the wing are about 10  higher than previously expected  although the   increases aren t uniform throughout the wing  The loads input data has been updated accordingly    There may be some additional external loads changes but these are expected to be very small    After reading the Playing the Game instructions and taking a quick look at your game screen  please fill   out the Pre Game Survey  When you have finished with the pre game survey  send a message to the   integrator that you are ready to begin  When everyone is ready  the game leader will reset the timer   and start the game    At

loads to   calculate the stress in each member and reports the safety factor       Submit Design sends the player s current member thickness and RF values to the integrator for   use in the global model       Get Global Model Loads retrieves load updates from the global model when the integrator   runs the global model  When load updates are available  section players will receive a message

designing simulation exercises  especially games that serve as   training simulations  Two key characteristics to balance in designing this simulation exercise were   fidelity and simplicity  Fidelity was necessary to both to ensure the outcomes of the simulation   reasonably applied to real life and to persuade participants that this was so  Simplicity was required to   ensure the simulation s key lessons could readily be grasped in a short period and to ensure that an   automated agent based simulation was tractable  Finally  where possible the game is designed to   maximize the breadth of its applicability so it can be used to teach the relevant principles to future   groups working on other projects    To be persuaded of the game s applicability to the team s processes  the team must believe the game s   key concepts apply to the team s actual work  A poorly designed simulation exercise is easily dismissed   because it fails to reflect key constraints and forces of participants  reality  A high fidelity simulation   that closely represents the team s work  on the other hand  more easily generates discussion and   learning around issues the team perceives as relevant to their work    A well designed simulation exercise must also be sufficiently simple to allow participants to quickly   comprehend the key principles the exercise is intended to illustrate  A simulation that represents the   team s work with extreme fidelity might obfuscate the key issues it seeks to address with the many   other complexities it includes    If it is intended as a training tool  it is also valuable to ensure the simulation applies to a broad range of   teams  work  This makes it advantageous to ensure the concepts illustrated by the simulation   incorporate issues faced by diverse teams    This tension between fidelity and simplicity is the primary challenge in making early simulation exercise   design decisions  In order to achieve the proper balance  simulation designers need to identify the most   important forces and information feedback structures in the team s work that contribute to the   problem to be examined    Finding the right balance between fidelity and simplicity plays out in more practical decisions  These   include the format and platform in which the game is played  the complexity of the game scenario and   decisions  the number of players to include  and the degree of challenge for participants  The designer   must also take care to make all these decisions in a strategy agnostic fashion  That is  the game and its   performance metrics should be built such that any strategies that generate successful results in the   game would reasonably produce positive results in reality while game strategies that give poor results   would reasonably give poor results in reality    133    Interactive multiplayer simulation games can take either a physical format or a digital one  Physical   games are appealing because they allow physical engagement as part of game play  Game player   decisions would in a sense involve more commitment if they were physical actions on mental decisions    Physical games also force designers to keep the design relatively simple and transparent  making them   easier to understand but making the lessons to be drawn from them more abstract  The primary   advantage of digital formats is the ability to create a simple user interface supported by higher fidelity   modeling and calculations in the background  However  the  black box  nature of this structure makes   it more difficult to maintain credibility if the simulation results are not consistent with participants    mental models and expectations    The complexity of the game scenario also balances between fidelity and simplicity  In this game s   attempt to mimic the structure of the sizing loop in the actual aircraft program this decision boiled   down to the number of players and the breadth of each player s design responsibility  A high number   of participants would generate a more complex multiplayer network  reflecting more accurately the   number of interface relationships in the actual airplane design  This would create a higher fidelity   simulation  On the other hand  too many players trying to interact with the game at once might   overwhelm that game s infrastructure or require too much training time to ensure each understood the   game     Finally  the game designer must carefully calibrate the degree of difficulty in crafting the game s   structure and metrics  Ideally the game is sufficiently challenging to fully engage the participants  best   efforts  but not so challenging they will become discouraged    134    Appendix D  Long Term Risks to OEMs of Risk Sharing Enterprises   Recent events indicate that suppliers can and will move up the commercial aerospace supply chain  In   2008  for example  long time Boeing airframe supplier Mitsubishi Heavy Industries created the   subsidiary Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation to produce regional jets  As it develops competency in full   aircraft design  assembly  and integration  the company could eventually seek to move upward to   building jetliners and capture market share from Boeing and Airbus    The Chinese government and aerospace industry seek to achieve this at an accelerated pace  Several   Chinese aerospace suppliers  under the umbrella of the China Aviation Industry Corporation I  AVIC I    have parlayed the knowledge they have gained through partnerships with Boeing  Cessna  and others    combined with their military aircraft experience  to develop the ARJ21 regional jet  In 2008 the   Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd  was created with the express purpose of developing its   own jetliner to be manufactured by the same suppliers that built the ARJ21    These competitive threats create a powerful incentive for OEMs in extended enterprises to aggressively   protect their competitive advantages and intellectual property  They want to develop strong   collaborative relationships with their suppliers without sharing so much information that suppliers   could learn enough to eventually displace them       135
