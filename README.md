NLP Analysis of LGO theses as part of research for MIT MIMO

Messy analyses that I did using SPECTER transformer based technique to get embeddings of whole thesis documents as well as using AWS Comprehend for topic modeling to evaluate changes and evolution of topics of manufacturing research over time.

Interesting notebooks to explore: analyzing_specter_embeddings_final and kmeans_explainer. The rest are very messy and difficult to follow and most of the interesting work is in these last two notebooks.
